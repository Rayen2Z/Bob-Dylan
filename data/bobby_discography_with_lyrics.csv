I froze right to the bone. New York Times said it was the coldest winter in seventeen years. I didn’t feel so cold then. . . I swung on to my old guitar. Grabbed hold of a subway car. And after a rocking, reeling, rolling ride. I landed up on the downtown side. Greenwich Village. . . I walked down there and ended up. In one of them coffeehouses on the block. Got on the stage to sing and play. Man there said, “Come back some other day. You sound like a hillbilly. We want folk singers here”. . Well, I got a harmonica job, begun to play. Blowing my lungs out for a dollar a day. I blowed inside out and upside down. The man there said he loved my sound. He was raving about how he loved my sound. Dollar a day’s worth. . . And after weeks and weeks of hanging around. I finally got a job in New York town. In a bigger place, bigger money too. Even joined the union and paid my dues. . . Now, a very great man once said. That some people rob you with a fountain pen. It didn’t take too long to find out. Just what he was talkin’ about. A lot of people don’t have much food on their table. But they got a lot of forks ’n’ knives. And they got to cut something. . . So one morning when the sun was warm. I rambled out of New York town. Pulled my cap down over my eyes. And headed out for the western skies. So long, New York. Howdy, East Orange"

19,A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall,The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan,1963,5,Original,2,". Oh, where have you been, my blue-eyed son?. And where have you been, my darling young one?. I’ve stumbled on the side of twelve misty mountains. I’ve walked and I’ve crawled on six crooked highways. I’ve stepped in the middle of seven sad forests. I’ve been out in front of a dozen dead oceans. I’ve been ten thousand miles in the mouth of a graveyard. . . And it’s a hard, and it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard. It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall. . . Oh, what did you see, my blue-eyed son?. And what did you see, my darling young one?. I saw a newborn baby with wild wolves all around it. I saw a highway of diamonds with nobody on it. I saw a black branch with blood that kept dripping. I saw a room full of men with their hammers a-bleeding. I saw a white ladder all covered with water. I saw ten-thousand talkers whose tongues were all broken. I saw guns and sharp swords in the hands of young children. . . And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard. It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall. . And what did you hear, my blue-eyed son?. And what did you hear, my darling young one?. I heard the sound of a thunder that roared out a warning. I heard the roar of a wave that could drown the whole world. I heard one hundred drummers whose hands were a-blazing. I heard ten-thousand whispering and nobody listening. I heard one person starve, I heard many people laughing. I heard the song of a poet who died in the gutter. I heard the sound of a clown who cried in the alley. . . And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard. It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall. . . Oh, what did you meet, my blue-eyed son?. And who did you meet, my darling young one?. I met a young child beside a dead pony. I met a white man who walked a black dog. I met a young woman, her body was burning. I met a young girl, she gave me a rainbow. I met one man who was wounded in love. I met another man who was wounded in hatred. . . And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard. It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall. . And what will you do now, my blue-eyed son?. And what will you do now, my darling young one?. I’m a-going back out ’fore the rain starts a-falling. I’ll walk to the depths of the deepest dark forest. Where the people are many and their hands are all empty. Where the pellets of poison are flooding their waters. Where the home in the valley meets the damp dirty prison. And the executioner’s face is always well hidden. Where hunger is ugly, where the souls are forgotten. Where black is the color, where none is the number. And I’ll tell it, and speak it, and think it, and breathe it. And reflect from the mountain so all souls can see it. Then I’ll stand on the ocean until I start sinking. But I’ll know my song well before I start singing. . . And it’s a hard, it’s a hard, it’s a hard, and it’s a hard. It’s a hard rain’s a-going to fall"
20,"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right",The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan,1963,5,Original,2,". Well, it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe. If'n you don't know by now. And it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe. It'll never do somehow. When your rooster crows at the break of dawn. Look out your window and I'll be gone. You're the reason I'm a-traveling on. But don't think twice, it's all right. . . And it ain't no use in a-turning on your light, babe. The light I never knowed. And it ain't no use in turning on your light, babe.

But don't think twice, it's all right. . . So it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal. Like you never done before. And it ain't no use in calling out my name, gal. I can't hear you anymore. I'm a-thinking and a-wondering, walking down the road. I once loved a woman, a child, I'm told. I give her my heart but she wanted my soul. But don't think twice, it's all right. . So long, honey babe. Where I'm bound, I can't tell. Goodbye's too good a word, babe. So I'll just say, ""Fare thee well"". I ain't a-saying you treated me unkind. You could've done better, but I don't mind. You just kinda wasted my precious time. But don't think twice, it's all right"
21,Bob Dylan's Dream,The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan,1963,5,Original,2,". While riding on a train going west. I fell asleep for to take my rest. I dreamed a dream that made me sad. Concerning myself and the first few friends I had. . . With half-damp eyes I stared to the room. Where my friends and I'd spent many an afternoon. Where we together weathered many a storm. Laughing and singing 'til the early hours of the morn. . . By the old wooden stove where our hats was hung. Our words was told, our songs was sung. Where we longed for nothing and were satisfied. Joking and talking about the world outside. . . With hungry hearts through the heat and cold. We never much thought we could get very old. We thought we could sit forever in fun. And our chances really was a million to one. . . . As easy it was to tell black from white. It was all that easy to tell wrong from right. And our choices, they was few, so the thought never hit. That the one road we traveled would ever shatter or split. . . How many a year has passed and gone. Many a gamble has been lost and won. And many a road taken by many a first friend. And each one I’ve never seen again. . . . . I wish, I wish, I wish in vain. That we could sit simply in that room again. Ten-thousand dollars at the drop of a hat. And I’d give it all gladly if our lives could be like that"

Hey, we're going down to Oxford Town. . . He went down to Oxford Town. Guns and clubs followed him down. All because his face was brown. Better get away from Oxford Town. . . Oxford Town around the bend. Come to the door, he couldn’t get in. All because of the color of his skin. What do you think about that, my friend?. . . Me, my girl, my girl’s son. We got met with a tear gas bomb. I don’t even know why we come. Going back where we come from. . . Oxford Town in the afternoon. Everybody singing a sorrowful tune. Two men died beneath the Mississippi moon. Somebody better investigate soon"
23,Talkin' World War III Blues,The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan,1963,5,Original,2,". One time ago a crazy dream came to me. I dreamt I was walking to World War Three. I went to the doctor the very next day. To see what kind of words he could say. He said it was a bad dream. ""I wouldn’t worry about it none, though. Them old dreams are only in your head"". . . I said “Hold it Doc, a World War passed through my brain”. He said “Nurse, get your pad, the boy’s insane”. He grabbed my arm, I said “Ouch!”. As I landed on the psychiatric couch. He said “Tell me about it”. . . Well, the whole thing started at 3 o’clock fast. It was all over by a quarter past. I was down in the sewer with some little lover. When I peeked out from a manhole cover. Wondering who turned the lights on us. . . Well, I got up and I walked around. Up and down the lonesome town. I stood a-wondering which way to go. I lit a cigarette on a parking meter. And walked on down the road. It was a normal day. . Well, I rung the fallout shelter bell. And I leaned my head and I give a yell. “Give me a string bean, I’m a hungry man”. A shotgun fired, and away I ran. I don’t blame him too much though, he didn't know me. . . Down at the corner by the hot-dog stand. I seen a man. I said “Howdy friend, I guess there’s just us two”. He screamed a bit, and away he flew. Thought I was a Communist. . . Well, I spied me a girl and before she could leave. I said “Let’s go play Adam and Eve”. I took her by the hand, and my heart was thumping. When she said “Hey man, you crazy or something?. You seen what happened last time they started”. . . Well, I seen me a Cadillac window uptown. There was nobody around. I got into the driver’s seat. And I drove down 42nd Street. In my Cadillac. Good car to drive after a war. . Well, I remember seeing some ad. So I turned on my Conelrad. But I didn’t pay the Con Ed bill. So the radio didn’t work so well. Turned on my record player —. It was Rock-a-Day Johnny, singing “Tell Your Ma, Tell Your Pa. Our Love’s A-going to Grow, Ooh-wah, Ooh-wah”. . . I was feeling kind of lonesome and blue. I needed somebody to talk to. So I called up the operator of time. Just to hear a voice of some kind. “When you hear the beep it will be 3 o’clock”. She said that for over an hour. And I hung up. . . Well, the doctor interrupted me just about then. Saying ""Hey, I’ve been having the same old dreams. But mine was a little different, you see. I dreamt the only person left after the war was me. I didn’t see you around"". . . Well, now time passed and now it seems. Everybody’s having them dreams. Everybody sees their self. Walking around with no one else. . ""Half of the people can be part right all of the time. And some of the people can be all right part of the time. But all of the people can’t be all right all of the time"". I think Abraham Lincoln said that. “I’ll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours”. I said that"

She’s a man-eater, meat-grinder, bad loser. . . Oh, there ain't no use in me working all the time. I got a woman who works herself blind. Works up to her britches, up to her neck. Writes me letters and sends me checks. She’s a humdinger, folk singer. . . Late one day in the middle of the week. Eyes were closed, I was half asleep. I chased me a woman up the hill. Right in the middle of an air-raid drill. I jumped a fallout shelter. I jumped a string bean. I jumped a TV dinner. I jumped a shotgun. . . Now, the man on the stand, he wants my vote. He’s a-running for office on the ballot note. He’s out there preaching in front of the steeple. Telling me he loves all kinds of people. He’s eatin' bagels. He’s eatin' pizza. He’s eatin' chitlins. Ooh. . Oh, set me down on a television floor. I’ll flip the channel to number four. Out of the shower comes a football man. With a bottle of oil in his hand. Greasy kid stuff. What I want to know, Mr. Football Man, is. What do you do about Willie Mays. Martin Luther King. Olatunji. Whoa-ho. . . Well, the funniest woman I ever seen. Was the great-granddaughter of Mr. Clean. She takes about fifteen baths a day. Wants me to grow a mustache on my face. She’s insane. . . Well, they ask me why I’m drunk all the time. It levels my head and eases my mind. I just walk along and stroll and sing. I see better days and I do better things. I catch dinosaurs. Make love to Elizabeth Taylor. Catch hell from Richard Burton"

32,Only a Pawn in Their Game,The Times They Are A-Changin',1964,1,Original,3,". A bullet from the back of a bush took Medgar Evers’ blood. A finger fired the trigger to his name.

He’s only a pawn in their game. . From the poverty shacks, he looks from the cracks to the tracks. And the hoof beats pound in his brain. And he’s taught how to walk in a pack.

He’s only a pawn in their game. . . Today, Medgar Evers was buried from the bullet he caught. They lowered him down as a king. But when the shadowy sun sets on the one. That fired the gun. He’ll see by his grave. On the stone that remains. Carved next to his name. His epitaph plain. Only a pawn in their game"

And the sun will respect. Every face on the deck. The hour that the ship comes in. . . Then the sands will roll. Out a carpet of gold. For your weary toes to be a-touchin'. And the ship's wise men. Will remind you once again. That the whole wide world is watchin'. . . Oh, the foes will rise. With the sleep still in their eyes. And they'll jerk from their beds and think they're dreamin'. But they'll pinch themselves and squeal. And they'll know that it's for real. The hour that the ship comes in. . . And they'll raise their hands. Sayin', ""We'll meet all your demands"".

She was fifty-one years old and gave birth to ten children. Who carried the dishes and took out the garbage. And never sat once at the head of the table.

36,Restless Farewell,The Times They Are A-Changin',1964,1,Original,3,"Oh all the money that in my whole life I did spend. Be it mine right or wrongfully. I let it slip gladly to my friends.

So I’ll bid farewell and be down the road. . Oh every girl that ever I’ve touched. I did not do it harmfully. And every girl that ever I’ve hurt. I did not do it knowingly. But to remain as friends.

Must meet the dawn. And if I see the day. I’d only have to stay. So I’ll bid farewell in the night and be gone. . I might go insane if it couldn’t be sprung. But it’s not to stand naked under unknowin' eyes. It’s for myself and my friends my stories are sung. But the time ain’t tall, if on time you depend. And no word is possessed by no special friend. And though the line is cut. It ain’t quite the end. I’ll just bid farewell 'til we meet again. . Oh a false clock tries to tick out my time. To disgrace, distract, and bother me.

So I’ll make my stand. And remain as I am. And bid farewell and not give a damn"

40,Chimes of Freedom,Another Side of Bob Dylan,1964,8,Original,4,". Far between sundown’s finish and midnight’s broken toll. We ducked inside the doorways, thunder went crashing. As majestic bells of bolts struck shadows in the sounds. Seemin' to be the chimes of freedom flashing. Flashing for the warriors whose strength is not to fight. Flashing for the refugees on the unarmed road of flight. And for each and every underdog soldier in the night. And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing. . . Through the city’s melted furnace, unexpectedly we watched. With faces hidden as the walls were tightening. As the echo of the wedding bells before the blowin’ rain. Dissolved into the bells of the lightning. Tolling for the rebel, tolling for the rake. Tolling for the luckless, they abandoned and forsaked. Tolling for the outcast, burning constantly at stake. And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing. . . Through the mad mystic hammering of the wild ripping hail. The sky cracked its poems in naked wonder. That the clinging of the church bells blew far into the breeze. Leavin' only bells of lightning and it's thunder. Striking for the gentle, striking for the kind. Striking for the guardians and protectors of the mind. And the poet and the painter far behind his rightful time. And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing. . And the wild cathedral evening the rain unraveled tales. For disrobed faceless forms of no position. Tolling for the tongues with no place to bring their thoughts. All down in taken-for-granted situations. Tolling for the deaf and blind, tolling for the mute. For the mistreated, mateless mother, the mistitled prostitute. For the misdemeanor outlaw, chained and cheated by pursuit. And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing. . . Even though a cloud’s white curtain in a far-off corner flared. And the hypnotic splattered mist was slowly lifting. Electric light still struck like arrows, fired but for the ones. Condemned to drift or else be kept from driftin'. Tolling for the searching ones, on their speechless, seeking trail. For the lonesome-hearted lovers with too personal a tale. And for each unharmful, gentle soul misplaced inside a jail. And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashing. . . Starry-eyed and laughing as I recall when we were caught. Trapped by no track of hours for they hanged suspended. As we listened one last time and we watched with one last look. Spellbound and swallowed ’til the tolling ended. Tolling for the aching whose wounds cannot be nursed. For the countless confused, accused, misused, strung-out ones and worse. And for every hung-up person in the whole wide universe. And we gazed upon the chimes of freedom flashin'"

Now, I’m liberal, but to a degree. I want everybody to be free. But if you think I’ll let Barry Goldwater. Move in next door and marry my daughter. You must think I’m crazy!. I wouldn’t let him do it for all the farms in Cuba. . Well, I set my monkey on the log. And ordered him to do the Dog. He wagged his tail and shook his head. And he went and did the Cat instead. He’s a weird monkey, very funky. . . I sat with my high-heeled sneakers on. Waitin' to play tennis in the noonday sun. I had my white shorts rolled up past my waist. And my wig-hat was fallin' in my face. But they wouldn’t let me on the tennis court. . . I got a woman, she’s so mean. She sticks my boots in the washing machine. Sticks me with buckshot when I’m nude. Puts bubblegum in my food. She’s funny, wants my money, calls me “honey”. . . Now I got a friend who spends his life. Stabbin' my picture with a Bowie knife. Dreams of stranglin' me with a scarf. When my name comes up he pretends to barf. I got a million friends!. . Now they asked me to read a poem. At the sorority sisters home. Ah got knocked down and my head was swimmin'. I wound up with the Dean of Women. Yippee! I’m a poet, and I know it. Hope I don’t blow it. . . I’m gonna grow my hair down to my feet so strange. So I look like a walking mountain range. And I’m gonna' ride into Omaha on a horse. Out to the country club and the golf course. Carryin' The New York Times, shoot a few holes, blow their minds. . . Now you’re probably wonderin' by now. Just what this song is all about. What’s probably got you baffled more. Is what this thing here is for:. . (plays song's riff). . It’s nothin'. It’s sumpin' I learned over in England!"
42,To Ramona,Another Side of Bob Dylan,1964,8,Original,4,". Ramona. Come closer. Shut softly your watery eyes. The pangs of your sadness. Will pass as your senses will rise. Oh the flowers of the city. Though breath-like. Get death-like at times. And there’s no use in trying. To deal with the dying. Though I cannot explain that in lines. . . Your cracked country lips. I still wish to kiss. As to be by the strength of your skin. Your magnetic movements. Still capture the minutes I’m in. But it grieves my heart, love. To see you trying to be a part of. A world that just don’t exist. It’s all just a dream, babe. A vacuum, a scheme, babe. That sucks you into feelin' like this. . I can see that your head. Has been twisted and fed. With the worthless foam from the mouth. I can tell you are torn. Between staying and returning. Back to the South. You’ve been fooled into thinking. That the finishing end is at hand. Yet there’s no one to beat you. No one to defeat you. 'cept the thoughts of yourself feeling bad. . . I’ve heard you say many times. That you’re better than no one. And no one is better than you. If you really believe that. You know you have nothing to win and nothing to lose. From fixtures and forces and friends. Your sorrow does stem. That hype you and type you. Making you feel. That you gotta' be just like them. . . I’d forever talk to you. But soon my words. Would turn into a meaningless ring. For deep in my heart. I know there's no help I can bring. Everything passes. Everything changes. Just do what you think you should do. And someday maybe. Who knows, baby. I’ll come and be crying to you"

44,My Back Pages,Another Side of Bob Dylan,1964,8,Original,4,". Crimson flames tied through my ears. Rolling high and mighty traps. Pounced with fire on flaming roads. Using ideas as my maps. ""We'll meet on edges, soon,"" said I. Proud 'neath heated brow. . . Ah, but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now. . . Half-wracked prejudice leaped forth. ""Rip down all hate,"" I screamed. Lies that life is black and white. Spoke from my skull, I dreamed. Romantic facts of musketeers. Foundationed deep, somehow. . . Ah, but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now. . . Girls' faces formed the forward path. From phony jealousy. To memorizing politics. Of ancient history. Flung down by corpse evangelists. Unthought of, though, somehow. . Ah, but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now. . . A self-ordained professor's tongue. Too serious to fool. Spouted out that liberty. Is just equality in school. ""Equality,"" I spoke the word. As if a wedding vow. . . Ah, but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now. . . In a soldier's stance, I aimed my hand. At the mongrel dogs who teach. Fearing not I'd become my enemy. In the instant that I preach. My existence led by confusion boats. Mutiny from stern to bow. . . Ah, but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now. . Yes, my guard stood hard when abstract threats. Too noble to neglect. Deceived me into thinking. I had something to protect. Good and bad, I define these terms. Quite clear, no doubt, somehow. . . Ah, but I was so much older then. I'm younger than that now"
45,I Don't Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met),Another Side of Bob Dylan,1964,8,Original,4,". I can't understand, she let go of my hand. And left me here facing the wall. I’d sure like to know why she'd go. But I can't get close to her at all. . Though we kissed through the wild blazing nighttime. She said she would never forget. But now morning’s clear, it’s like I ain't here. She acts like we never met. . . It’s all new to me, like some mystery. It could even be like a myth. But it’s hard to think on that she’s the same one. That last night I was with. . From darkness, dreams are deserted. Am I still dreaming yet?. I wish she’d unlock her voice once and talk. 'Stead of actin' like we never have met. . . If she ain't feelin' well, then why don’t she tell. 'Stead of turnin' her back to my face?. Without any doubt, she seems too far out. For me to return to or chase. . Her mouth was watery and wet. But now something has changed, for she ain't the same. She just acts like we never have met. . . If I didn’t have to guess, I’d gladly confess. To anything I might’ve tried. If I was with her too long or have done something wrong. I'd wish she’d tell me what it is, I’ll run and hide. . Though the night ran swirling and whirling. I remember her whispering yet. But evidently she don’t, evidently she won’t. She just acts like we never have met. . . I’m leavin' today, I’ll be on my way. Of this I can't say very much. But if you want me to, I can be just like you. And pretend that we never have touched. . And if anybody asks me. “Is it easy to forget?”. I’ll say, “It’s easily done, you just pick anyone. And pretend that you never have met!”"
46,Ballad in Plain D,Another Side of Bob Dylan,1964,8,Original,4,". I once loved a girl, her skin it was bronze. With the innocence of a lamb, she was gentle like a fawn. I courted her proudly but now she is gone. Gone as the season she's taken. . . In a young summer's youth, I stole her away. From her mother and sister, though close did they stay. Each one of them suffering from the failures of their day. With strings of guilt they tried hard to guide us. . . Of the two sisters, I loved the young. With sensitive instincts, she was the creative one. Their constant scrapegoat, she was easily undone. By the jealousy of others around her. . . For her parasite sister, I had no respect. Bound by her boredom, her pride to protect. Countless visions of the other she'd reflect. As a crutch for her scenes and her society. . . Myself, for what I did, I cannot be excused. The changes I was going through can't even be used. For the lies that I told her in hope not to lose. The could-be dream-lover of my lifetime. . With unseen consciousness, I possessed in my grip. A magnificent mantelpiece, though its heart being chipped. Noticing not that I'd already slipped. To the sin of love's false security. . . From silhouetted anger to manufactured peace. Answers of emptiness voice vacancies. 'Til the tombstones of damage read no questions but please. What's wrong, what's exactly the matter?. . . And so it did happen like it could have been foreseen. The timeless explosion of fantasy's dream. At the peak of the night, the king and the queen. Tumbled all down into pieces. . . ""The tragic figure"" her sister did shout. ""Leave her alone, God damn you, get out"". And I in my armor, turning about. And nailing her in the ruins of her pettiness. . . Beneath a bare light bulb the plaster did pound. Her sister and I in a screaming battleground. And she in between, the victim of sound. Soon shattered as a child to the shadows. . All is gone, all is gone, admit it, take flight. I gagged in contradiction, tears blinding my sight. My mind it was mangled, I ran into the night. Leaving all of love's ashes behind me. . . The wind knocks my window, the room it is wet. The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet. I think of her often and hope whoever she's met. Will be fully aware of how precious she is. . . Ah, my friends from the prison, they ask unto me. ""How good, how good does it feel to be free?"". And I answer them most mysteriously. ""Are birds free from the chains of the skyway?"""
47,It Ain't Me Babe,Another Side of Bob Dylan,1964,8,Original,4,". Go away from my window. Leave at your own chosen speed. I’m not the one you want, babe. I’m not the one you need. You say you're looking for someone. Who's never weak but always strong. To protect you and defend you. Whether you are right or wrong. Someone to open each and every door. . . But it ain't me, babe. No, no, no, it ain't me, babe. It ain't me you’re looking for, babe. . . Go lightly from the ledge, babe. Go lightly on the ground. I’m not the one you want, babe. I will only let you down. You say you're looking for someone. Who will promise never to part. Someone to close his eyes for you. Someone to close his heart. Someone who will die for you and more. . But it ain't me, babe. No, no, no, it ain't me, babe. It ain't me you’re looking for, babe. . . Go melt back in the night. Everything inside is made of stone. There's nothing in here moving. And anyway I'm not alone. You say you're lookin' for someone. Who'll pick you up each time you fall. To gather flowers constantly. And to come each time you call. A lover for your life and nothing more. . . But it ain't me, babe. No, no, no, it ain't me, babe. It ain't me you’re looking for, babe"

The man in a trench coat, badge out, laid off. Says he's got a bad cough, wants to get it paid off. Look out kid, it's somethin' you did. God knows when, but you're doin' it again. You better duck down the alleyway, looking for a new friend. The man in the coon-skin cap in a pig pen. Wants 11 dollar bills – you only got 10. . . Maggie comes fleet foot, face full of black soot.

You don't need a weather man to know which way the wind blows. . . Oh, get sick, get well, hang around a ink well. Hang bail, hard to tell if anything is gonna sell. Try hard, get barred, get back, ride rail. Get jailed, jump bail, join the Army if you fail. Look out kid, you're gonna get hit. By losers, cheaters, six-time users. Hanging 'round the theaters. Girl by the whirlpool's looking for a new fool. Don't follow leaders, a-watch the parking meters. . Oh, get born, keep warm. Short pants, romance. Learn to dance, get dressed. Get blessed, try to be a success. Please her, please him, buy gifts. Don't steal, don't lift. 20 years of schoolin' and they put you on the day shift. Look out kid, they keep it all hid. Better jump down a manhole, light yourself a candle. Don't wear sandals, try to avoid the scandals. Don't want to be a bum, you better chew gum. The pump don't work 'cause the vandals took the handles"

Yet she's true, like ice, like fire. . . People carry roses. And make promises by the hours. My love she laughs like the flowers. Valentines can't buy her. . . In the dime stores and bus stations.

I was riding on the Mayflower when I thought I spied some land. I yelled for Captain Arab, I have you understand. Who came running to the deck, said, ""Boys, forget the whale. Look on over yonder, cut the engines, change the sail. Haul on the bowline"", we sang that melody. Like all tough sailors do when they're far away at sea. . . ""I think I'll call it America,"" I said as we hit land. I took a deep breath, I fell down, I could not stand. Captain Arab he started writing up some deeds. He said, ""Let's set up a fort and start buyin' a place with beads"". Just then this cop comes down the street, crazy as a loon. He throws us all in jail for carrying harpoons. . . Ah, me I busted out, don't even ask me how. I went to get some help, I walked by a Guernsey cow. Who directed me down to the Bowery slums. Where people carried signs around sayin', ""Ban the bums"". I jumped right into line sayin' ""I hope that I'm not late"". When I realized I hadn't eaten for five days straight. . I went into a restaurant looking for the cook. I told him I was the editor of a famous etiquette book. The waitress he was handsome, he wore a powder blue cape. I ordered some Suzette, I said ""could you please make that Crepe?"". Just then the whole kitchen exploded from boilin' fat. Food was flyin' everywhere, I left without my hat. . . Now, I didn't mean to be nosy but I went into a bank. To get some bail for Arab and all the boys back in the tank. They asked me for some collateral and I pulled down my pants. They threw me in the alley when up comes this girl from France. Who invited me to her house, I went but she had a friend. Who knocked me out and robbed my boots and I was on the street again. . . Well, I rapped upon a house with the U.S. flag upon display. I said, ""Could you help me out, I got some friends down the way"". ""The man says, ""Get out of here, I'll tear you limb from limb"". I said, ""You know they refused Jesus, too"", he said, ""You're not Him. Get out of here before I break your bones, I ain't your pop"". I decided to have him arrested and I went lookin' for a cop. . . I ran right outside, I hopped inside a cab. I went out the other door, this Englishman said, ""Fab"". As he saw me leap a hot dog stand and a chariot that stood. Parked across from a building advertising brotherhood. I ran right through the front door like a hobo sailor does. But it was just a funeral parlor and the man asked me who I was. . I repeated that my friends were all in jail with a sigh. He gave me his card, he said, ""Call me if they die"". I shook his hand and said goodbye, ran out to the street. When a bowling ball came down the road and knocked me off my feet. A pay phone was ringing and it just about blew my mind. When I picked it up and said hello, this foot came through the line. . . Well, by this time I's fed up at tryin' to make a stab. At bringing back any help for my friends and Captain Arab. I decided to flip a coin like either heads or tails. Would let me know if I should go back to ship or back to jail. So I hocked my sailor suit and I got a coin to flip. It came up tails, it rhymed with sails, so I made it back to the ship. . . Well, I got back and took the parking ticket off the mast. I was ripping it to shreds when this coastguard boat went past. They asked me my name and I said, ""Captain Kidd"". They believed me but they wanted to know what exactly that I did. I said for the Pope of Eruke I was employed. They let me go right away, they were very paranoid. . . Well, the last I heard of Arab, he was stuck on a whale. That was married to the deputy sheriff of the jail. But the funniest thing was when I was leavin' the bay. I saw three ships sailin' there, were all heading my way. I asked the captain what his name was and how come he didn't drive a truck. He said his name was Columbus, I just said, ""Good luck"""

Though you might hear laughing, spinning, swinging madly across the sun. It's not aimed at anyone, it's just escaping on the run. And but for the sky there are no fences facing.

It's just a shadow you're seeing that he's chasing. . . Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me. I'm not sleepy, and there is no place I'm going to. Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me.

The haunted, frightened trees, out to the windy beach. Far from the twisted reach of crazy sorrow. Yes, to dance beneath the diamond sky with one hand waving free. Silhouetted by the sea, circled by the circus sands. With all memory and fate driven deep beneath the waves. Let me forget about today until tomorrow. . Hey, Mr. Tambourine Man, play a song for me.

56,Gates of Eden,Bringing It All Back Home,1965,3,Original,5,". Of war and peace the truth just twists. Its curfew gull it glides. Upon four-legged forest clouds. The cowboy angel rides. With his candle lit into the sun. Though its glow is waxed in black. All except when 'neath the trees of Eden. . . The lamppost stands with folded arms. Its iron claws attached. To curbs 'neath holes where babies wail. Though it shadows metal badge. All and all can only fall. With a crashing but meaningless blow. No sound ever comes from the Gates of Eden. . . The savage soldier sticks his head in sand. And then complains. Unto the shoeless hunter who's gone deaf. But still remains. Upon the beach where hound dogs bay. At ships with tattooed sails. Heading for the Gates of Eden. . With a time-rusted compass blade. Aladdin and his lamp. Sits with Utopian hermit monks. Sidesaddle on the Golden Calf. And on their promises of paradise. You will not hear a laugh. All except inside the Gates of Eden. . . Relationships of ownership. They whisper in the wings. To those condemned to act accordingly. And wait for succeeding kings. And I try to harmonize with songs. The lonesome sparrow sings. There are no kings inside the Gates of Eden. . . The motorcycle Black Madonna. Two-wheeled gypsy queen. And her silver-studded phantom cause. The gray flannel dwarf to scream. As he weeps to wicked birds of prey. Who pick up on his bread crumb sins. And there are no sins inside the Gates of Eden. . The kingdoms of Experience. In the precious winds they rot. While paupers change possessions. Each one wishing for what the other has got. And the princess and the prince discuss. What's real and what is not. It doesn't matter inside the Gates of Eden. . . The foreign sun, it squints upon. A bed that is never mine. As friends and other strangers. From their fates try to resign. Leaving men wholly, totally free. To do anything they wish to do but die. And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden. . . At dawn my lover comes to me. And tells me of her dreams. With no attempts to shovel the glimpse. Into the ditch of what each one means. At times I think there are no words. But these to tell what's true. And there are no truths outside the Gates of Eden"
57,"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)",Bringing It All Back Home,1965,3,Original,5,". Darkness at the break of noon. Shadows even the silver spoon. The handmade blade, the child's balloon. Eclipses both the sun and moon. To understand you know too soon. There is no sense in trying. . . Pointed threats they bluff with scorn. Suicide remarks are torn. From the fools gold mouthpiece the hollow horn. Plays wasted words, proves to warn. That he not busy being born. Is busy dying. . . Temptation's page flies out the door. You follow, find yourself at war. Watch waterfalls of pity roar. You feel to moan, but unlike before. You discover that you'd just be one more. Person crying. . . So don't fear if you hear. A foreign sound to your ear. It's alright, Ma, I'm only sighing. . As some warn victory, some downfall. Private reasons, great or small. Can be seen in the eyes of those that call. To make all that should be killed to crawl. While others say don't hate nothing at all. Except hatred. . . Disillusioned words like bullets bark. As human gods aim for their mark. Make everything from toy guns that spark. To flesh-colored Christs that glow in the dark. It's easy to see without looking too far. That not much is really sacred. . . While preachers preach of evil fates. Teachers teach that knowledge waits. Can lead to hundred-dollar plates. Goodness hides behind its gates. But even the President of the United States. Sometimes must have to stand naked. . . And though the rules of the road have been lodged. It's only people's games that you got to dodge. And it's alright, Ma, I can make it. . Advertising signs that con. You into thinking you're the one. That can do what's never been done. That can win what's never been won. Meantime, life outside goes on. All around you. . . You lose yourself, you reappear. You suddenly find you got nothing to fear. Alone you stand with nobody near. When a trembling distant voice, unclear. Startles your sleeping ears to hear. That somebody thinks they really found you. . . A question in your nerves is lit. Yet you know there is no answer fit. To satisfy, ensure you not to quit. To keep it in your mind and not forget. That it is not he, or she, or them, or it. That you belong to. . . But though the masters make the rules. For the wise men and the fools. I got nothing, Ma, to live up to. . For them that must obey authority. That they do not respect in any degree. Who despise their jobs, their destiny. Speak jealously of them that are free. Do what they do just to be. Nothing more than something they invest in. . . While some on principles baptized. To strict party platform ties. Social clubs in drag disguise. Outsiders they can freely criticize. Tell nothing except who to idolize. And say ""God bless him"". . . While one who sings with his tongue on fire. Gargles in the rat race choir. Bent out of shape from society's pliers. Cares not to come up any higher. But rather get you down in the hole. That he's in. . . But I mean no harm, nor put fault. On anyone that lives in a vault. But it's alright, Ma, if I can't please him. . . Old lady judges watch people in pairs. Limited in sex, they dare. To push fake morals, insult and stare. While money doesn't talk, it swears. Obscenity, who really cares. Propaganda, all is phony. . . While them that defend what they cannot see. With a killer's pride, security. It blows the minds most bitterly. For them that think death's honesty. Won't fall upon 'em naturally. Life sometimes must get lonely. . . My eyes collide head-on with stuffed. Graveyards, false goals, I scuff. At pettiness which plays so rough. Walk upside down inside handcuffs. Kick my legs to crash it off. Say, okay, I've had enough. What else can you show me?. . . And if my thought-dreams could be seen. They'd probably put my head in a guillotine. But it's alright, Ma, it's life, and life only"
58,"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue",Bringing It All Back Home,1965,3,Original,5,". You must leave now. Take what you need, you think will last. But whatever you wish to keep, you better grab it fast. Yonder stands your orphan with his gun. Crying like a fire in the sun. . . Look out, the saints are coming through. And it's all over now, Baby Blue. . . The highway is for gamblers, better use your sense. Take what you have gathered from coincidence. The empty handed painter from your streets. Is drawing crazy patterns on your sheets. . . The sky, too, is folding under you. And it's all over now, Baby Blue. . . All your seasick sailors, they are rowing home. Your empty-handed armies are going home. Your lover, who just walked out the door. Has taken all his blankets from the floor. . The carpet, too, is moving under you. And it's all over now, Baby Blue. . . . . Leave your stepping stones behind. There's something that calls for you. Forget the dead you've left. They will not follow you. The vagabond who's rapping at your door. Is standing in the clothes that you once wore. . . Strike another match, go start anew. And it's all over now, Baby Blue"
59,Like a Rolling Stone,Highway 61 Revisited,1965,8,Original,6,". Once upon a time you dressed so fine. Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?. People call, say ""Beware doll, you're bound to fall"". You thought they were all a-kiddin' you. You used to laugh about. Everybody that was hangin' out. Now you don't talk so loud. Now you don't seem so proud. About having to be scrounging your next meal. . . How does it feel?. How does it feel?. To be without a home?. Like a complete unknown?. Like a rolling stone?. . . Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely. But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it. Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street. And now you’re gonna have to get used to it. You say you never compromise. With the mystery tramp, but now you realize. He's not selling any alibis. As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes. And say, “Do you want to make a deal?"". . How does it feel?. How does it feel?. To be on your own. With no direction home. A complete unknown. Like a rolling stone?. . . Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns. On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you. Never understood that it ain't no good. You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you. You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat. Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat. Ain't it hard when you discover that. He really wasn't where it's at. After he took from you everything he could steal?. . . How does it feel?. How does it feel?. To hang on your own. With no direction home. Like a complete unknown. Like a rolling stone?. . Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people. They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made. Exchangin' all precious gifts. But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe. You used to be so amused. At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used. Go to him now, he calls ya, ya can't refuse. When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose. You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal. . How does it feel?. Aw, how does it feel?. To be on your own. With no direction home. Like a complete unknown. Like a rolling stone?"
60,Tombstone Blues,Highway 61 Revisited,1965,8,Original,6,". The sweet pretty things are in bed now of course. The city fathers they’re trying to endorse. The reincarnation of Paul Revere’s horse. But the town has no need to be nervous. The ghost of Belle Starr she hands down her wits. To Jezebel the nun she violently knits. A bald wig for Jack the Ripper who sits. At the head of the chamber of commerce. . . Mama’s in the factory. She ain't got no shoes. Daddy’s in the alley. He’s lookin' for food. I am in the kitchen. With the tombstone blues. . . The hysterical bride in the penny arcade. Screaming she moans, “I’ve just been made”. Then sends out for the doctor who pulls down the shade. And says, “My advice is to not let the boys in”. Now the medicine man comes and he shuffles inside. He walks with a swagger and he says to the bride. “Stop all this weeping, swallow your pride. You will not die, it’s not poison”. . Mama’s in the factory. She ain't got no shoes. Daddy’s in the alley. He’s lookin' for food. I’m in the kitchen. With the tombstone blues. . . Well, John the Baptist, after torturing a thief. Looks up at his hero, the commander-in-chief. Saying, “Tell me, great hero, but please make it brief. Is there a hole for me to get sick in?”. The commander-in-chief answers him while chasing a fly. Saying, ""Death to all those who would whimper and cry"". And dropping a barbell, he points to the sky. Saying, ""The sun’s not yellow, it’s chicken"". . . Mama’s in the factory. She ain't got no shoes. Daddy’s in the alley. He’s lookin' for food. I am in the kitchen. With the tombstone blues. . The king of the Philistines his soldiers to save. Puts jawbones on their tombstones and flatters their graves. Puts the pied pipers in prison and fattens the slaves. Then sends them out to the jungle. Gypsy Davey with a blowtorch he burns out their camps. With his faithful slave Pedro behind him he tramps. With a fantastic collection of stamps. To win friends and influence his uncle. . . Mama’s in the factory. She ain't got no shoes. Daddy’s in the alley. He’s lookin' for food. I’m in trouble. With the tombstone blues. . . The geometry of innocent flesh on the bone. Causes Galileo’s math book to get thrown. At Delilah who's sitting worthlessly alone. But the tears on her cheeks are from laughter. Now I wish I could give Brother Bill his great thrill. I would set him in chains at the top of the hill. Then send out for some pillars and Cecil B. DeMille. He could die happily ever after. . Mama’s in the factory. She ain't got no shoes. Daddy’s in the alley. He’s lookin' for food. I am in the kitchen. With the tombstone blues. . . Where Ma Rainey and Beethoven once unwrapped their bedroll. Tuba players now rehearse around the flagpole. And the National Bank at a profit sells road maps for the soul. To the old folks home and the college. Now I wish I could write you a melody so plain. That could hold you dear lady from going insane. That could ease you and cool you and cease the pain. Of your useless and pointless knowledge. . . Mama’s in the factory. She ain't got no shoes. Daddy’s in the alley. He’s lookin' for food. I am in the kitchen. With the tombstone blues"
61,"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry",Highway 61 Revisited,1965,8,Original,6,". Well, I ride on a mail train, baby. Can't buy a thrill. Well, I been up all night. Leanin' on the windowsill. Well, if I die. On top of the hill. And if I don’t make it. You know my baby will. . . Don't the moon look good, mama. Shining through the trees?. Don't the brakeman look good, mama. Flaggin' down the “Double E?”. Don't the sun look good. Goin' down over the sea?. But don’t my gal look fine. When she's comin' after me?. . . Now the wintertime is coming. The windows are filled with frost. I went to tell everybody. But I could not get across. Well, I want to be your lover, baby. I don’t want to be your boss. Don’t say I never warned you. When your train gets lost"
62,From a Buick 6,Highway 61 Revisited,1965,8,Original,6,". I got this graveyard woman, you know. She keeps my kids. But my soulful mama, you know. She keeps me hid. She’s a junkyard angel, and she. Always gives me bread. . . Well, if I go down dyin', you know. She bound to put a blanket on my bed. . . Well, when the pipeline gets broken. And I'm lost on the river bridge. I’m all cracked up on the highway. And in the water’s edge. Here again she comes, down the thruway. Ready to sew me up with a thread. . . Well, if I go down dyin', you know. She bound to put a blanket on my bed. . . Well, she don’t make me nervous. She don’t talk too much. She walks like Bo Diddley. And she don’t need no crutch. She keeps this .410. All loaded with lead. . Well, if I go down dyin', you know. She bound to put a blanket on my bed. . . Come on!. . . Well, you know I. Need a steam shovel, mama, to. Keep away the dead.

63,Ballad of a Thin Man,Highway 61 Revisited,1965,8,Original,6,". You walk into the room. With your pencil in your hand. You see somebody naked. And you, you say, ""Who is that man?"". You try so hard. But you don't understand. Just what you will say. When you get home. . . Because something is happening here. But ya' don't know what it is. Do you, Mister Jones?. . . You raise up your head. And you ask, ""Is this where it is?"". And somebody points to you and says. ""It's his"". And you say, ""What's mine?"". And somebody else says, ""Well, what is?"". And you say, ""Oh my God, am I here all alone?"". . . But something is happening here. But ya' don't know what it is. Do you, Mister Jones?. . You hand in your ticket. And you go watch the geek. Who immediately walks up to you. When he hears you speak. And says, ""How does it feel to. Be such a freak?"". And you say, ""Impossible"". As he hands you a bone. . . And something is happening here. But ya' don't know what it is. Do you, Mister Jones?. . . You have many contacts. Among the lumberjacks. To get you facts. When someone attacks your imagination. But nobody has any respect. Anyway they already expect you. To all give a check. To tax-deductible charity organization. Aw, you've been with the professors. And they've all liked your looks. With great lawyers you have. Discussed lepers and crooks. You've been through all of. F. Scott Fitzgerald's books. You are very well read. It's well known. . But something is happening here. But ya' don't know what it is. Do you, Mister Jones?. . . Well the sword swallower, he comes up to you. And then he kneels. He crosses himself. And then he clicks his high heels. And without further notice. He asks you how it feels. And he says, ""Here is your throat back. Thanks for the loan"". . . And something is happening here. But ya' don't know what it is. Do you, Mister Jones?. . . Now you see this one-eyed midget. Shouting the word ""Now"". And you say, ""For what reason?"". And he says, ""How?"". And you say, ""What does this mean?"". And he screams back ""You're a cow. Give me some milk or else go home"". . And you know something is happening here. But ya' don't know what it is. Do you, Mister Jones?. . . Well, you walk into the room. Like a camel and then you frown. You put your eyes in your pocket. And your nose on the ground. There oughtta be a law. Against you comin' around. You should be made. To wear earphones. . . 'Cause something is happening here. But ya' don't know what it is. Do you, Mister Jones?"
64,Queen Jane Approximately,Highway 61 Revisited,1965,8,Original,6,"When your mother sends back all your invitations. And your father to your sister he explains.

66,Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues,Highway 61 Revisited,1965,8,Original,6,". When you're lost in the rain in Juarez. When it's Easter time too. And your gravity fails. And negativity don't pull you through. Don't put on any airs. When you're down on Rue Morgue Avenue. They got some hungry women there. And they really make a mess outta you. . . Now if you see Saint Annie. Please tell her ""Thanks a lot"". I cannot move. My fingers are all in a knot. I don't have the strength. To get up and take another shot. And my best friend, my doctor. Won't even say what it is I've got. . . Sweet Melinda. The peasants call her the Goddess of Gloom. She speaks good English. And she invites you up into her room. And you're so kind. And careful not to go to her too soon. And she takes your voice. And leaves you howling at the moon. . Up on Housing Project Hill. It's either fortune or fame. You must pick one or the other. Though neither of them are to be what they claim. If you're lookin' to get silly. You better go back to from where you came. Because the cops don't need you. And man, they expect the same. . . Now all the authorities. They just stand around and boast. How they blackmailed the Sergeant-at-Arms. Into leaving his post. And picking up Angel. Who just arrived here from the coast. Who looked so fine at first. But left lookin' just like a ghost. . . I started out on Burgundy. But soon hit the harder stuff. Everybody said they'd stand behind me. When the game got rough. But the joke was on me. There was nobody even there to bluff. I'm going back to New York City. I do believe I've had enough"
67,Desolation Row,Highway 61 Revisited,1965,8,Original,6,". They're selling postcards of the hanging. They're painting the passports brown. The beauty parlor is filled with sailors. The circus is in town. Here comes the blind commissioner. They've got him in a trance. One hand is tied to the tight-rope walker. The other is in his pants. And the riot squad, they're restless. They need somewhere to go. As Lady and I look out tonight. From Desolation Row. . Cinderella, she seems so easy. ""It takes one to know one,"" she smiles. And puts her hands in her back pockets. Bette Davis style. And in comes Romeo, he's moaning. ""You Belong to Me, I Believe"". And someone says, ""You're in the wrong place, my friend. You'd better leave"". . . And the only sound that's left. After the ambulances go. Is Cinderella sweeping up. On Desolation Row. . Now the moon is almost hidden. The stars are beginning to hide. The fortune-telling lady. Has even taken all her things inside. All except for Cain and Abel. And the hunchback of Notre Dame. Everybody is making love. Or else expecting rain. And the Good Samaritan, he's dressing. He's getting ready for the show. He's going to the carnival tonight. On Desolation Row. . Ophelia, she's 'neath the window. For her I feel so afraid. On her twenty-second birthday. She already is an old maid. To her, death is quite romantic. She wears an iron vest. Her profession's her religion. Her sin is her lifelessness. And though her eyes are fixed upon. Noah's great rainbow. She spends her time peeking. Into Desolation Row. . Einstein, disguised as Robin Hood. With his memories in a trunk. Passed this way an hour ago. With his friend, a jealous monk. Now he looked so immaculately frightful. As he bummed a cigarette. Then he went off sniffing drainpipes. And reciting the alphabet. You would not think to look at him. But he was famous long ago. For playing the electric violin. On Desolation Row. . Dr. Filth, he keeps his world. Inside of a leather cup. But all his sexless patients. They're trying to blow it up. Now his nurse, some local loser. She's in charge of the cyanide hole. And she also keeps the cards that read. ""Have mercy on his soul"". They all play on the pennywhistle. You can hear them blow. If you lean your head out far enough. From Desolation Row. . Across the street they've nailed the curtains. They're getting ready for the feast. The Phantom of the Opera. In a perfect image of a priest. They are spoon feeding Casanova. To get him to feel more assured. Then they'll kill him with self-confidence. After poisoning him with words. And the Phantom's shouting to skinny girls. ""Get outta here if you don't know. Casanova is just being punished for going. To Desolation Row"". . . At midnight all the agents. And the superhuman crew. Come out and round up everyone. That knows more than they do. Then they bring them to the factory. Where the heart attack machine. Is strapped across their shoulders. And then the kerosene. Is brought down from the castles. By insurance men who go. Check to see that nobody is escaping. To Desolation Row. . Praise be to Nero's Neptune. The Titanic sails at dawn. Everybody's shouting. ""Which side are you on?"". And Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot. Fighting in the captain's tower. While calypso singers laugh at them. And fishermen hold flowers. Between the windows of the sea. Where lovely mermaids flow. And nobody has to think too much. About Desolation Row. . . . . Yes, I received your letter yesterday. About the time the doorknob broke. When you asked me how I was doing. Was that some kinda joke?. All these people that you mention. Yes, I know them, they're quite lame. I had to rearrange their faces. And give them all another name. Right now, I can't read too good. Don't send me no more letters, no. Not unless you mail them. From Desolation Row. . "

69,Pledging My Time,Blonde on Blonde,1966,5,Original,7,". Well, early in the morning. 'Til late at night. I got a poison headache. But I feel alright. . . I’m pledgin' my time to you. Hopin' you’ll come through, too. . . Well, the hobo got too high. And he came to me naturally. He stole my baby. Then he wanted to steal me. . . And I’m pledging my time to you. Hopin' you’ll come through, too. . . Won’t you come with me, baby?. I’ll take you where you want to go. And if it don’t work out. You’ll be the first to know. . I’m pledging my time to you.

Hopin' you’ll come through, too. . . Well they sent for the ambulance. And one was sent. Somebody got lucky. But it was an accident. . . I’m pledging my time to you. Hopin' you’ll come through, too"
70,Visions of Johanna,Blonde on Blonde,1966,5,Original,7,". Ain't it just like the night to play. Tricks when you're trying to be so quiet?. We sit here stranded. Though we're all doing our best to deny it. And Louise holds a handful of rain, tempting you to defy it. Lights flicker from the opposite loft. In this room the heat pipes just cough. The country music station plays soft. But there's nothing, really nothing to turn off. Just Louise and her lover so entwined. And these visions of Johanna that conquer my mind. . . In the empty lot where the ladies play. Blindman's bluff with the key chain. And the all-night girls. They whisper of escapades out on the ""D"" train. We can hear the night watchman click his flashlight. Ask himself if it's him or them that's insane. Louise, she's all right, she's just near. She's delicate and seems like the mirror. But she just makes it all too concise and too clear. That Johanna's not here. The ghost of 'lectricity howls in the bones of her face. Where these visions of Johanna have now taken my place. . Now, little boy lost, he takes himself so seriously. He brags of his misery, he likes to live dangerously. And when bringing her name up. He speaks of a farewell kiss to me. He's sure got a lotta gall. To be so useless and all. Muttering small talk at the wall while I'm in the hall. Oh, how can I explain?. It's so hard to get on. And these visions of Johanna, they kept me up past the dawn. . . Inside the museums, Infinity goes up on trial. Voices echo, ""This is what salvation must be like after a while"". But Mona Lisa musta had the highway blues. You can tell by the way she smiles. See the primitive wallflower freeze. When the jelly-faced women all sneeze. Hear the one with the mustache say, ""Jeez, I can't find my knees"". Oh, jewels and binoculars hang from the head of the mule. But these visions of Johanna, they make it all seem so cruel. . . The peddler now speaks. To the countess who's pretending to care for him. Sayin', ""Name me someone that's not a parasite. And I'll go out and say a prayer for him"". But like Louise always says. ""You can't look at much, can you, man?"". As she, herself, prepares for him. And Madonna, she still has not showed. We see this empty cage now corrode. Where her cape of the stage once had flowed. The fiddler, he now steps to the road. He writes everything's been returned which was owed. On the back of the fish truck that loads. While my conscience explodes. The harmonicas play the skeleton keys and the rain. And these visions of Johanna are now all that remain"
71,One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later),Blonde on Blonde,1966,5,Original,7,". I didn't mean to treat you so bad. You shouldn't take it so personal. I didn't mean to make you so sad. You just happened to be there, that's all. When I saw you say goodbye to your friend and smile. I thought that it was well understood. That you'd be comin' back in a little while. I didn't know that you were sayin' goodbye for good. . . But, sooner or later, one of us must know. That you just did what you're supposed to do. Sooner or later, one of us must know. That I really did try to get close to you. . . I couldn't see what you could show me. Your scarf had kept your mouth well hid. I couldn't see how you could know me. But you said you knew me and I believed you did. When you whispered in my ear. And asked me if I was leavin' with you or her. I didn't realize just what I did hear. I didn't realize how young you were. . But, sooner or later, one of us must know. That you just did what you're supposed to do. Sooner or later, one of us must know. That I really did try to get close to you. . . And I couldn't see when it started snowin'. Your voice was all that I heard. I couldn't see where we were goin'. But you said you knew and I took your word. And then you told me later, as I apologized. That you were just kiddin' me, you weren't really from the farm. And I told you, as you clawed out my eyes. That I never really meant to do you any harm. . . But, sooner or later, one of us must know. That you just did what you're supposed to do. Sooner or later, one of us must know. That I really did try to get close to you"
72,I Want You,Blonde on Blonde,1966,5,Original,7,". The guilty undertaker sighs. The lonesome organ grinder cries. The silver saxophones say I should refuse you.

The drunken politician leaps. Upon the street where mothers weep. And the saviors who are fast asleep, they wait for you. And I wait for them to interrupt. Me drinking from my broken cup. And ask me to. Open up the gate for you. . . I want you, I want you. Yes I want you, so bad. Honey, I want you. . How my fathers, they’ve gone down. True love they’ve been without it. But all their daughters put me down. 'Cause I don’t think about it. . . Well, I'll return to the Queen of Spades. And talk with my chambermaid. She knows that I’m not afraid to look at her. She is good to me. And there’s nothing she doesn’t see. She knows where I’d like to be. But it doesn’t matter. . . I want you, I want you. Yes I want you, so bad. Honey, I want you. . . Now your dancing child with his Chinese suit. He spoke to me, I took his flute. No, I wasn’t very cute to him, was I?. But I did it, because he lied. And because he took you for a ride.

To be stuck inside of Mobile. With the Memphis blues again. . . Well, Shakespeare, he's in the alley. With his pointed shoes and his bells. Speaking to some French girl. Who says she knows me well. And I would send a message. To find out if she's talked. But the post office has been stolen. And the mailbox is locked. . Oh, Mama. Can this really be the end?. To be stuck inside of Mobile.

To be stuck inside of Mobile. With the Memphis blues again. . . Now the senator came down here. Showing everyone his gun. Handing out free tickets. To the wedding of his son.

With the Memphis blues again. . . Now the tea preacher looked so baffled. When I asked him why he dressed. With twenty pounds of headlines. Stapled to his chest.

To be stuck inside of Mobile. With the Memphis blues again. . . Now the rainman gave me two cures. Then he said, ""Jump right in"". The one was Texas medicine. The other was just railroad gin. And like a fool I mixed them. And it strangled up my mind. And now people just get uglier. And I have no sense of time. . . Oh, Mama. Can this really be the end?. To be stuck inside of Mobile. With the Memphis blues again. . . Now when Ruthie says come see her. In her honky-tonk lagoon. Where I can watch her waltz for free. 'Neath her Panamanian moon. And I say, ""Aw, come on now. You know you know about my debutante"". And she says, ""Your debutante just knows what you need. But I know what you want"". . . Oh, Mama. Can this really be the end?. To be stuck inside of Mobile. With the Memphis blues again. . . Now the bricks lay on Grand Street. Where the neon madmen climb. They all fall there so perfectly. It all seems so well timed. And here I sit so patiently. Waiting to find out what price. You have to pay to get out of. Going through all these things twice. . . Oh, Mama. Is this really the end?. To be stuck here inside of Mobile. With the Memphis blues again"

79,4th Time Around,Blonde on Blonde,1966,5,Original,7,". When she said. “Don’t waste your words, they’re just lies”. I cried she was deaf. And she worked on my face until breaking my eyes.

80,Obviously 5 Believers,Blonde on Blonde,1966,5,Original,7,"Helen Keller had said in 1911: ""We vote? What does that mean?"" And Emma Goldman around the same time: ""Our modern fetish is universal suffrage."" After 1920, women were voting, as men did, and their subordinate condition had hardly changed. . Right after women got the vote, the measure of their social progress can he seen in an advice column written by Dorothy Dix that appeared in newspapers all over the country. The woman should not merely be a domestic drudge, she said:. . . a man's wife is the show window where he exhibits the measure of his achievement. . The biggest deals are put across over luncheon tables;. we meet at dinner the people who can push our fortunes. . The woman who cultivates a circle of worthwhile people, who belongs to clubs, who makes herself interesting and agreeable . is a help to her husband. . Robert and Helen Lynd, studying Muncie, Indiana (Middletown), in the late twenties, noted the importance of good looks and dress in the assessment of women. Also, they found that when men spoke frankly among themselves they were ""likely to speak of women as creatures purer and morally better than men but as relatively impractical, emotional, unstable, given to prejudice, easily hurt, and largely incapable of facing facts or doing hard thinking."". . A writer in early 1930, boosting the beauty business, started off a magazine article with the sentence: ""The average American woman has sixteen square feet of skin."" He went on to say that there were forty thousand beauty shops in the country, and that $2 billion was spent each year on cosmetics for women—but this was insufficient: ""American women are not yet spending even one- fifth of the amount necessary to improve their appearance."" He then gave an itemized list of the ""annual beauty needs of every woman"": twelve hot-oil treatments, fifty-two facials, twenty-six eyebrow plucks, etc. . It seems that women have best been able to make their first escape from the prison of wifeliness, motherhood, femininity, housework, beautification, isolation, when their services have been desperately needed-whether in industry, or in war, or in social movements. Each time practicality pulled the woman out of her prison-in a kind of work-parole program-the attempt was made to push her back once the need was over, and this led to women's struggle for change. . World War II had brought more women than ever before out of the home into work. By 1960, 36 percent of all women sixteen and older- 23 million women-worked for paid wages. But although 43 percent of women with school-age children worked, there were nursery schools for only 2 percent- the rest had to work things out themselves. Women were 50 percent of the voters-but (even by 1967) they held 4 percent of the state legislative seats, and 2 percent of the judgeships. The median income of the working woman was about one-third that of the man. And attitudes toward women did not seem to have changed much since the twenties. . ""There is no overt anti-feminism in our society in 1964,"" wrote feminist and sociologist Alice Rossi, ""not because sex equality has been achieved, but because there is practically no feminist spark left among American women."". . In the civil rights movement of the sixties, the signs of a collective stirring began to appear. Women took the place they customarily took in social movements, in the front lines-as privates, not generals. In the office of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee in Atlanta, a Spelman College student named Ruby Doris Smith, who had been jailed during the sit-ins, expressed their anger at the way women were relegated to the routine office work, and she was joined in her protest by two white women in SNCC, Sandra Hayden and Mary King. The men in SNCC listened to them respectfully, read the position paper they had put together asserting their rights, but did not do very much. Ella Baker, a veteran fighter from Harlem, now organizing in the South, knew the pattern: ""I knew from the beginning that as a woman, an older woman in a group of ministers who are accustomed to having women largely as supporters, there was no place for me to have come into a leadership role."". . Nevertheless, women played a crucial role in those early dangerous years of organizing in the South, and were looked on with admiration. Many of these were older women like Ella Baker, and Amelia Boynton in Selma, Alabama, and ""Mama Dolly"" in Albany, Georgia. Younger women- Gloria Richardson in Maryland, Annelle Ponder in Mississippi-were not only active, but leaders. Women of all ages demonstrated, went to jail. Mrs. Fannie Lou Hamer, a sharecropper in Ruleville, Mississippi, became legendary as organizer and speaker. She sang hymns; she walked picket lines with her familiar limp (as a child she contracted polio). She roused people to excitement at mass meetings: ""I'm sick an' tired o' bein' sick an' tired!"". . Around the same time, white, middle-class, professional women were beginning to speak up. A pioneering, early book, strong and influential, was Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique. . Just what was the problem that has no name? What were the words women used when they tried to express it? Sometimes a woman would say ""I feel empty somehow . . . incomplete."" Or she would say, ""I feel as if I don't exist."" Sometimes. ""A tired feeling . I get so angry with the children it scares me. . I feel like crying without any reason."". . Friedan wrote out of her experience as a middle-class housewife, but what she spoke about touched something inside all women:. The problem lay buried, unspoken for many years in the minds of American women. It was a strange stirring, -A sense of dissatisfaction, a yearning that women suffered in the middle of the twentieth century in the United States. Each suburban wire struggled with it alone. As she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slip-cover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, lay beside her husband at night-she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question- ""Is this all?"". . But on an April morning in 1959, I heard a mother of four, having coffee with four other mothers in a suburban development fifteen miles from New York, say in a tone of quiet desperation, ""the problem."" And the others knew, without words, that she was not talking about a problem with her husband, or her children, or her home. Suddenly they realized they all shared the same problem, the problem that has no name. They began, hesitantly, to talk about it. Later, after they had picked up their children at nursery school and taken them home to nap, two of the women cried, in sheer relief, just to know they were not alone. . The ""mystique"" that Friedan spoke of was the image of the woman as mother, as wife, living through her husband, through her children, giving up her own dreams for that. She concluded: ""The only way for a woman, as for a man, to find herself, to know herself as a person, is by creative work of her own."". . In the summer of 1964, in McComb, Mississippi, at a Freedom House (a civil rights headquarters where people worked and lived together) the women went on strike against the men who wanted them to cook and make beds while the men went around in cars organizing. The stirring that Friedan spoke of was true of women everywhere, it seemed. . By 1969, women were 40 percent of the entire labor force of the United States, but a substantial number of these were secretaries, cleaning women, elementary school teachers, saleswomen, waitresses, and nurses. One out of every three working women had a husband earning less than $5,000 a year. . What of the women who didn't have jobs? They worked very hard, at home, but this wasn't looked on as work, because in a capitalist society (or perhaps in any modern society where things and people are bought and sold for money), if work is not paid for, not given a money value, it is considered valueless. Women began to think more about this fact in the 1960s, and Margaret Benston wrote about it (""The Political Economy of Women's Liberation""), Women doing housework were people outside the modern economic system, therefore they were like serfs or peasants, she said. . The women who worked in the typical ""woman's job""-secretary, receptionist, typist, salesperson, cleaning woman, nurse-were treated to the full range of humiliations that men in subordinate positions faced at work, plus another set of humiliations stemming from being a woman: gibes at their mental processes, sexual jokes and aggression, invisibility except as sexual objects, cold demands for more efficiency. A commercial ""Guide to Clerical Times Standards"" printed a question-and-answer column:. . Q. I'm a businessman, and my secretary seems to move entirely too slowly. How many times a minute should she be able to open and close a file drawer?. A. Exactly 25 times. Times for other ""open and close operations"" . are .04 minutes for opening or closing a folder, and .026 minutes for opening a standard center desk drawer. If you're worried about her ""chair activity,"" clock her against these standards: ""Got up from chair,"" .033 minutes; ""turn in swivel chair,"" .009 minutes. . A woman factory worker in New Bedford, Massachusetts, in the early seventies, in a medium-sized corporation whose president's dividends from the corporation in 1970 amounted to $325,000, wrote in an organizing newspaper that 9 percent of the workers in her department were women, but all the supervisors were men. . A few years ago I was suspended for three days from work because my children were still young and I had to take time off when they were sick. . . . They want people who keep quiet, squeal on one another, and are very good little robots. The fact that many have to take nerve pills before starting their day, and a week doesn't go by that there aren't two or three people who break down and cry, doesn't mean a thing to them. . She added: ""But times are changing, and from now on, more people will speak out and demand from their so-called bosses that they be treated the way the bosses themselves would like to he treated."". . Times indeed were changing. Around 1967, women in the various movements-civil rights, Students for a Democratic Society, antiwar groups-began meeting as women, and in early 1968, at a women's antiwar meeting in Washington, hundreds of women carrying torches paraded to the Arlington National Cemetery and staged ""The Burial of Traditional Womanhood."" At this point, and later too, there was some disagreement among women, and even more among men, on whether women should battle on specifically women's issues, or just take part in general movements against racism, war, capitalism. But the idea of a feminist focus grew. . In the fall of 1968, a group called Radical Women attracted national attention when they protested the selection of Miss America, which they called ""an image that oppresses women."" They all threw bras, girdles, curlers, false eyelashes, wigs, and other things they called ""women's garbage"" into a Freedom Trash Can. A sheep was crowned Miss America. More important, people were beginning to speak of ""Women's Liberation."". Some of the New York Radical Women shortly afterward formed WITCH (Women's International terrorist Conspiracy from Hell), and its members, dressed as witches, appeared suddenly on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. A leaflet put out by WITCH in New York said:. . WITCH lives and laughs in every woman. She is the free part of each of us, beneath the shy smiles, the acquiescence to absurd male domination, the make-up or flesh-suffocating clothes our sick society demands. There is no ""joining"" WITCH. If you are a woman and dare to look within yourself, you are a WITCH. You make your own rules. . WITCH in Washington, D.C., protested at the United Fruit Company for the corporation's activities in the Third World and its treatment of its women office workers. In Chicago it protested the firing of a radical feminist teacher named Marlene Dixon. . Poor women, black women, expressed the universal problem of women in their own way. In 1964 Robert Coles (Children of Crisis) interviewed a black woman from the South recently moved to Boston, who spoke of the desperation of her life, the difficulty of finding happiness: ""To me, having a baby inside me is the only lime I'm really alive."". . Without talking specifically about their problems as women, many women, among the poor, did as they had always done, quietly organized neighborhood people to right injustices, to get needed services. In the mid-1960s, ten thousand black people in a community in Atlanta called Vine City joined together to help one another: they set up a thrift shop, a nursery, a medical clinic, monthly family suppers, a newspaper, a family counseling service. One of the organizers, Helen Howard, told Gerda Lerner (Black Women in White America) about it:. . I organized this neighborhood organization, two men and six ladies started it. That was a hard pull. A lot of people joined in later. For about five months we had meetings pretty near every night. We learned how to work with other people. . A lot of people were afraid to really do anything. You were afraid to go to the city hall or ask for anything. You didn't even ask the landlord for anything, you were afraid of him. Then we had meetings and then we weren't afraid so much anymore. . . . . The way we got this playground: we blocked off the street, wouldn't let anything come through. We wouldn't let the trolley bus come through. The whole neighborhood was in it. Took record players and danced; it went on for a week. We didn't get arrested, they was too many of us. So then the city put up this playground for the kids. . . A woman named Patricia Robinson wrote a pamphlet called Poor Black Woman, in which she connected the problems of women with the need for basic social change:. . Rebellion by poor black women, the bottom of a class hierarchy heretofore not discussed, places the question of what kind of society will the poor black woman demand and struggle for. Already she demands the right to have birth control, like middle class black and white women. She is aware that it takes two to oppress and that she and other poor people no longer are submitting to oppression, in this case genocide. She allies herself with the have-nots in the wider world and their revolutionary struggles. She had been forced by historical conditions to withdraw the children from male dominance and to educate and support them herself. In this very process, male authority and exploitation are seriously weakened. Further, she realizes that the children will be used as all poor children have been used through history-as poorly paid mercenaries fighting to keep or put an elite group in power. Through these steps . . she has begun to question aggressive male domination and the class society which enforces it, capitalism. . In 1970, Dorothy Bolden, a laundry worker in Atlanta and mother of six, told why in 1968 she began organizing women doing housework, into the National Domestic Workers Union. She said: ""I think women should have a voice in making decisions in their community for betterment. Because this woman in the slum is scuffling hard, and she's got a very good intelligent mind to do things, and she's been overlooked for so many years. I think she should have a voice."". . Women tennis players organized. A woman fought to be a jockey, won her case, became the first woman jockey. Women artists picketed the Whitney Museum, charging sex discrimination in a sculptors' show. Women journalists picketed the Gridiron Club in Washington, which excluded women. By the start of 1974, women's studies programs existed at seventy-eight institutions, and about two thousand courses on women were being offered at about five hundred campuses. . Women's magazines and newspapers began appearing, locally and nationally, and books on women's history and the movement came out in such numbers that some bookstores had special sections for them. The very jokes on television, some sympathetic, some caustic, showed how national was the effect of the movement. Certain television commercials, which women felt humiliated them, were eliminated after protest. . In 1967, after lobbying by women's groups, President Johnson signed an executive order banning sex discrimination in federally connected employment, and in the years that followed, women's groups demanded that this he enforced. Over a thousand suits were initiated by NOW (National Organization for Women, formed in 1966) against U.S. corporations charging sex discrimination. The right to abortion became a major issue. Before 1970, about a million abortions were done every year, of which only about ten thousand were legal. Perhaps a third of the women having illegal abortions- mostly poor people-had to be hospitalized for complications. How many thousands died as a result of these illegal abortions no one really knows. But the illegalization of abortion clearly worked against the poor, for the rich could manage either to have their baby or to have their abortion under safe conditions. . Court actions to do away with the laws against abortions were begun in over twenty states between 1968 and 1970, and public opinion grew stronger for the right of women to decide for themselves without government interference. In the book Sisterhood Is Powerful, an important collection of women's writing around 1970, an article by Lucinda Cisler, ""Unfinished Business: Birth Control,"" said that ""abortion is a woman's right . no one can veto her decision and compel her to bear a child against her will. .""In the spring of 1969 a Harris poll showed that 64 percent of those polled thought the decision on abortion was a private matter. . Finally, in early 1973, the Supreme Court decided (Roe v. Wade, Doe v. Bolton) that the state could prohibit abortions only in the last three months of pregnancy, that it could regulate abortion for health purposes during the second three months of pregnancy, and during the first three months, a woman and her doctor had the right to decide. . There was a push for child care centers, and although women did not succeed in getting much help from government, thousands of cooperative child care centers were set up. . Women also began to speak openly, for the first time, about the problem of rape. Each year, fifty thousand rapes were reported and many more were unreported. Women began taking self-defense courses. There were protests against the way police treated women, interrogated them, insulted them, when women filed rape charges. A book by Susan Brownmiller, Against Our Will, was widely read-it is a powerful, indignant history and analysis of rape, suggesting self-defense, individual or collective:. . Fighting back. On a multiplicity of levels, that is the activity we must engage in, together, if we- women-are to redress the imbalance and rid ourselves and men of the ideology of rape. Rape can be eradicated, not merely controlled or avoided on an individual basis, but the approach must be long- range and cooperative, and must have the understanding and good will of many men as well as women. . . Many women were active in trying to get a Constitutional amendment, ERA (Equal Rights Amendment), passed by enough states. But it seemed clear that even if it became law, it would not be enough, that what women had accomplished had come through organization, action, protest. Even where the law was helpful it was helpful only if backed by action. Shirley Chisholm, a black Congresswoman, said:. . The law cannot do it for us. We must do it for ourselves. Women in this country must become revolutionaries. We must refuse to accept the old, the traditional roles and stereotypes. We must replace the old, negative thoughts about our femininity with positive thoughts and positive action. . Perhaps the most profound effect of the women's movement of the sixties-beyond the actual victories on abortion, in job equality-was called ""consciousness raising,"" often done in ""women's groups,"" which met in homes all across the country. This meant the rethinking of roles, the rejection of inferiority, the confidence in self, a bond of sisterhood, a new solidarity of mother and daughter. The Atlanta poet Esta Seaton wrote ""Her Life"":. . This is the picture that keeps forming in my mind:. my young mother, barely seventeen,. cooking their Kosher dinner on the coal stove,. that first winter in Vermont,. and my father, mute in his feelings. except when he shouted,. eating to show his love. . Fifty years later her blue eyes would grow cold. with the shock of that grey house. and the babies one after another. and the doctor who said. ""If you don't want any more children. move out of the house."". . For the first time, the sheer biological uniqueness of women was openly discussed. Some theorists (Shulamith Firestone, in The Dialectics of Sex, for instance) thought this was more fundamental to their oppression than any particular economic system. It was liberating to talk frankly about what had for so long been secret, hidden, cause for shame and embarrassment: menstruation, masturbation, menopause, abortion, lesbianism. . One of the most influential books to appear in the early seventies was a book assembled by eleven women in the Boston Women's Health Book Collective called Our Bodies, Ourselves. It contained an enormous amount of practical information, on women's anatomy, on sexuality and sexual relationships, on lesbianism, on nutrition and health, on rape, self-defense, venereal disease, birth control, abortion, pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause. More important even than the information, the charts, the photos, the candid exploration of the previously unmentioned, was the mood of exuberance throughout the book, the enjoyment of the body, the happiness with the new- found understanding, the new sisterhood with young women, middle-aged women, older women. They quoted the English suffragette Christabel Pankhurst:. . Remember the dignity. of your womanhood. Do not appeal,. do not beg,. do not grovel. Take courage. join hands,. stand beside us. Fight with us. . . The fight began, many women were saying, with the body, which seemed to be the beginning of the exploitation of women-as sex plaything (weak and incompetent), as pregnant woman (helpless), as middle-aged woman (no longer considered beautiful), as older woman (to be ignored, set aside). A biological prison had been created by men and society. As Adrienne Rich said (Of Woman Born): ""Women are controlled by lashing us to our bodies."" She wrote:. . I have a very clear, keen memory of myself the day after I was married: I was sweeping a floor. Probably the floor did not really need to be swept; probably I simply did not know what else to do with myself. But as I swept that floor I thought: ""Now I am a woman. This is an age-old action, this is what women have always done."" I felt I was bending to some ancient form, too ancient to question. This is what women have always done. . As soon as I was visibly and clearly pregnant, I felt, for the first time in my adolescent and adult life, not-guilty. The atmosphere of approval in which I was bathed-even by strangers on the street, it seemed-was like an aura I carried with me, in which doubts, fears, misgivings met with absolute denial. This is what women have always done. . Rich said women could use the body ""as a resource, rather than a destiny."" Patriarchal systems, she said, whether under capitalism or ""socialism,"" limited women's bodies to their own needs. She discussed the training of passivity in women. Generations of schoolgirls were raised on Little Women, where Jo is told by her mother: ""I am angry nearly every day of my life, Jo; but I have learned not to show it; and I still hope to learn not to feel it, though it may take me another forty years to do so."". . Male doctors used instruments to bring out children, replacing the sensitive hands of midwives, in the era of ""anesthetized, technologized childbirth."" Rich disagreed with her fellow feminist Firestone, who wanted to change the biological inevitability of childbirth, because it is painful and a source of subordination; she wanted, under different social conditions, to make childbirth a source of physical and emotional joy. . One could not talk of Freud's ignorance of women, Rich said, as his one ""blind spot,"" which implied that in other matters his vision was clear; such ignorance distorts all. There is a dilemma of the body:. . I know no woman-virgin, mother, lesbian, married, celibate-whether she earns her keep as a housewife, a cocktail waitress, or a scanner of brain waves-for whom her body is not a fundamental problem: its clouded meaning, its fertility, its desire, its so-called frigidity, its bloody speech, its silences, its changes and mutilations, its rapes and ripenings. . Her reply to this: the ""repossession of our bodies . a world in which every woman is the presiding genius of her own body"" as a basis for bringing forth not just children but new visions, new meanings, a new world. . For most women who were not intellectuals, the question was even more immediate: how to eliminate hunger, suffering, subordination, humiliation, in the here and now. A woman named Johnnie Tillmon wrote in 1972:. . I'm a woman. I'm a black woman. I'm a poor woman. I'm a fat woman. I'm a middle-aged woman. And I'm on welfare. . I have raised six children. I grew up in Arkansas . . worked there for fifteen years in a laundry . . moved to California. . In 1963 I got too sick to work anymore. Friends helped me to go on welfare. . . . Welfare's like a traffic accident. It can happen to anybody, but especially it happens to women. . And that is why welfare is a women's issue. For a lot of middle-class women in this country, Women's Liberation is a matter of concern. For women on welfare it's a matter of survival. . Welfare, she said, was like ""a supersexist marriage. You trade in a man for the man. ""The man runs everything . . . controls your money. . . ."" She and other welfare mothers organized a National Welfare Rights Organization. They urged that women be paid for their work-housekeeping, child rearing. "". . No woman can he liberated, until all women get off their knees."". . In the problem of women was the germ of a solution, not only for their oppression, but for everybody's. The control of women in society was ingeniously effective. It was not done directly by the state. Instead, the family was used-men to control women, women to control children, all to be preoccupied with one another, to turn to one another for help, to blame one another for trouble, to do violence to one another when tidings weren't going right. Why could this not be turned around? Could women liberating themselves, children freeing themselves, men and women beginning to understand one another, find the source of their common oppression outside rather than in one another? Perhaps then they could create nuggets of strength in their own relationships, millions of pockets of insurrection. They could revolutionize thought and behavior in exactly that seclusion of family privacy which the system had counted on to do its work of control and indoctrination. And together, instead of at odds-male, female, parents, children-they could undertake the changing of society itself. . It was a time of uprisings. If there could be rebellion inside that most subtle and complex of prisons-the family-it was reasonable that there be rebellions in the most brutal and obvious of prisons: the penitentiary system itself. In the sixties and early seventies, those rebellions multiplied. They also took on an unprecedented political character and the ferocity of class war, coming to a climax at Attica, New York, in September of 1971. . The prison had arisen in the United States as an attempt at Quaker reform, to replace mutilation, hanging, exile-the traditional punishments during colonial times. The prison was intended, through isolation, to produce repentance and salvation, but prisoners went insane and died in that isolation. By mid-nineteenth century, the prison was based on hard labor, along with various punishments: sweat boxes, iron yokes, solitary. The approach was summed up by the warden at the Ossining, New York, penitentiary: ""In order to reform a criminal you must first break his spirit."" That approach persisted. . Prison officials would convene annually to congratulate themselves on the progress being made. The president of the American Correctional Association, delivering the annual address in 1966, described the new edition of the Manual of Correctional Standards: ""It permits us to linger, if we will, at the gates of correctional Valhalla-with an abiding pride in the sense of a job superbly done! We may be proud, we may be satisfied, we may be content."" He said this just after, in the midst of, and just before the most intense series of prison uprisings the country had ever seen. . There had always been prison riots. A wave of them in the 1920s ended with a riot at Clinton, New York, a prison of 1,600 inmates, which was suppressed with three prisoners killed. Between 1950 and 1953 more than fifty major riots occurred in American prisons. In the early 1960s, prisoners on a work gang in Georgia smashing rocks used the same sledgehammers to break their legs, to call attention to their situation of daily brutality. . At San Quentin prison in California, which housed four thousand prisoners, there was a series of revolts in the late sixties: a race riot in 1967, a united black-white general strike in early 1968 that shut down almost all the prison industries, and then a second strike that summer. . At the Queens House of Detention on Long Island in New York in the fall of 1970, prisoners took over the jail, took hostages, issued demands. The prisoners' negotiating committee included four blacks, one Puerto Rican, one white; they demanded immediate bail hearings on forty-seven cases that they said were examples of racism in the granting of bail. Judges came inside the prison, granted some paroles and reductions, and the hostages were released. But when the prisoners continued to hold out, police stormed the jail with tear gas and clubs and the revolt was over. . Around the same time, in November 1970, in Folsom prison in California, a work stoppage began which became the longest prison strike in the history of the United States. Most of the 2,400 prisoners held out in their cells for nineteen days, without food, in the face of threats and intimidation. The strike was broken with a combination of force and deception, and four of the prisoners were sent on a fourteen-hour ride to another prison, shackled and naked on the floor of a van. One of the rebels wrote: "". . . the spirit of awareness has grown. . The seed has been planted. . . ."". . The prisons in the United States had long been an extreme reflection of the American system itself: the stark life differences between rich and poor, the racism, the use of victims against one another, the lack of resources of the underclass to speak out, the endless ""reforms"" that changed little. Dostoevski once said: ""The degree of civilization in a society can be judged by entering its prisons."". . It had long been true, and prisoners knew this better than anyone, that the poorer you were the more likely you were to end up in jail. This was not just because the poor committed more crimes. In fact, they did. The rich did not have to commit crimes to get what they wanted; the laws were on their side. But when the rich did commit crimes, they often were not prosecuted, and if they were they could get out on bail, hire clever lawyers, get better treatment from judges. Somehow, the jails ended up full of poor black people. . In 1969, there were 502 convictions for tax fraud. Such cases, called ""white-collar crimes,"" usually involve people with a good deal of money. Of those convicted, 20 percent ended up in jail. The fraud averaged $190,000 per case; their sentences averaged seven months. That same year, for burglary and auto theft (crimes of the poor) 60 percent ended up in prison. The auto thefts averaged $992; the sentences averaged eighteen months. The burglaries averaged $321; the sentences averaged thirty-three months. . Willard Gaylin, a psychiatrist, relates (Partial Justice) a case which, with changes in details, could be multiplied thousands of rimes. He had just interviewed seventeen Jehovah"

Said I, “But you have no choice”. “I beg you, sir,” she pleaded. From the corners of her mouth. “I will secretly accept you. And together we’ll fly south”. . . Just then Tom Paine, himself. Came running from across the field. Shouting at this lovely girl. And commanding her to yield. And as she was letting go her grip. Up Tom Paine did run. “I’m sorry, sir,” he said to me. “I’m sorry for what she’s done”"

86,The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest,John Wesley Harding,1967,12,Original,8,". Well, Frankie Lee and Judas Priest. They were the best of friends. So when Frankie Lee needed money one day. Judas quickly pulled out a roll of tens. And placed them on a footstool. Just above the plotted plain. Sayin', “Take your pick, Frankie Boy. My loss will be your gain”. . . Well, Frankie Lee, he sat right down. And put his fingers to his chin. But with the cold eyes of Judas on him. His head began to spin. “Could ya please not stare at me like that?,” he said. “It’s just my foolish pride. But sometimes a man must be alone. And this is no place to hide”. . . Well, Judas, he just winked and said. “Alright, I’ll leave you here. But you’d better hurry up and choose which of those bills you want. Before they all disappear”. “I’m gonna start my pickin' right now. Just tell me where you’ll be”. Judas pointed down the road. And said, “Eternity!”. . “Eternity?” said Frankie Lee. With a voice as cold as ice. “That’s right,” said Judas, “Eternity. Though you might call it ‘Paradise’”. “I don’t call it anything”. Said Frankie Lee with a smile. “All right,” said Judas Priest. “I’ll see you after a while”. . . Well, Frankie Lee, he sat back down. Feeling low and mean. When just then a passin' stranger. Burst upon the scene. Saying, “Are you Frankie Lee, the gambler. Whose father's deceased?. Well, if you are, there’s a fellow callin' you down the road. And they say his name is Priest”. . . “Oh, yes, he is my friend”. Said Frankie Lee in fright. “I do recall him very well. In fact, he just left my sight”. “Yes, that’s the one,” said the stranger. As quiet as a mouse. “Well, my message is, he’s down the road. Stranded in a house”. . Well, Frankie Lee, he panicked. He dropped everything and ran. Until he came up to the spot. Where Judas Priest did stand. “What kind of house is this,” he said. “Where I have come to roam?”. “It’s not a house,” says Judas Priest. “It’s not a house, it’s a home”. . . Well, Frankie Lee, he trembled. He soon lost all control. Over ev’rything which he had made. While the mission bells did toll. He just stood there staring. At that big house as bright as any sun. With four and twenty windows. And a woman’s face in ev’ry one. . . Well, up the stairs ran Frankie Lee. With a soulful, bounding leap. And, foaming at the mouth. He began to make his midnight creep. For sixteen nights and days he raved. But on the seventeenth he burst. Into the arms of Judas Priest. Which is where he died of thirst. . No one tried to say a thing. When they carried him out in jest. Except, of course, the little neighbor boy. Who carried him to rest. And he just walked along, alone. With his guilt so well concealed. And muttered underneath his breath. “Nothing is revealed”. . . Well, the moral of this story. The moral of this song. Is simply that one should never be. Where one does not belong. So when you see your neighbor carrying somethin'. Help him with his load. And don’t go mistaking Paradise. For that home across the road"

The stage was set, the lights went out all around the old hotel. I hate myself for loving’ you and I’m glad the curtain fell. . . I hate that foolish game we played and the need that was expressed. And the mercy that you showed to me, who ever would have guessed?. I went out on Lower Broadway and I felt that place within. That hollow place where martyrs weep and angels play with sin. . . Heard your songs of freedom and man forever stripped. Acting out his folly while his back is being whipped. Like a slave in orbit, he’s beaten ’till he’s tame. All for a moment’s glory and it’s a dirty, rotten shame. . . There are those who worship loneliness, I’m not one of them. In this age of fiberglass I’m searching for a gem. The crystal ball up on the wall hasn’t shown me nothing yet. I’ve paid the price of solitude, but at least I’m out of debt. . . Can’t recall a useful thing you ever did for me. ’Cept pat me on the back one time when I was on my knees. We stared into each other’s eyes ’till one of us would break. No use to apologize, what difference would it make?. . So sing your praise of progress and of the Doom Machine. The naked truth is still taboo whenever it can be seen.

I’ve said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street. To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun. I love you more than ever and I haven’t yet begun. . . You breathed on me and made my life a richer one to live. When I was deep in poverty you taught me how to give. Dried the tears up from my dreams and pulled me from the hole. I love you more than ever and it burns me to the soul. . . You gave me babies one, two, three, what is more, you saved my life. Eye for eye and tooth for tooth, your love cuts like a knife. My thoughts of you don’t ever rest, they’d kill me if I lie. I’d sacrifice the world for you and watch my senses die. . . The tune that is yours and mine to play upon this earth. We’ll play it out the best we know, whatever it is worth. What’s lost is lost, we can’t regain what went down in the flood. But happiness to me is you and I love you more than blood. .

168,Tangled Up in Blue,Blood on the Tracks,1975,1,Original,15,". Early one morning the sun was shining. I was laying in bed. Wondering if she'd changed at all. If her hair was still red. Her folks they said our lives together. Sure was going to be rough. They never did like Mama's homemade dress. Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough. And I was standing on the side of the road. Rain falling on my shoes. Heading out for the East Coast. Lord knows I've paid some dues. Getting through. Tangled up in blue. . . She was married when we first met. Soon to be divorced. I helped her out of a jam, I guess. But I used a little too much force. We drove that car as far as we could. Abandoned it out west. Split up on a dark sad night. Both agreeing it was best. She turned around to look at me. As I was walking away. I heard her say over my shoulder. ""We'll meet again someday. On the avenue"". Tangled up in blue. . I had a job in the great north woods. Working as a cook for a spell. But I never did like it all that much. And one day the ax just fell. So I drifted down to New Orleans. Where I lucky was to be employed. Working for a while on a fishing boat. Right outside of Delacroix. But all the while I was alone. The past was close behind. I seen a lot of women. But she never escaped my mind. And I just grew. Tangled up in blue. . . She was working in a topless place. And I stopped in for a beer. I just kept looking at the side of her face. In the spotlight, so clear. And later on, when the crowd thinned out. I was just about to do the same. She was standing there, in back of my chair. Said, ""Tell me, don't I know your name?"". I muttered something underneath my breath. She studied the lines on my face. I must admit, I felt a little uneasy. When she bent down to tie the laces. Of my shoe. Tangled up in blue. . She lit a burner on the stove. And offered me a pipe. ""I thought you'd never say hello,"" she said. ""You look like the silent type"". Then she opened up a book of poems. And handed it to me. Written by an Italian poet. From the thirteenth century. And every one of them words rang true. And glowed like burning coal. Pouring off of every page. Like it was written in my soul. From me to you. Tangled up in blue. . . I lived with them on Montague Street. In a basement down the stairs. There was music in the cafes at night. And revolution in the air. Then he started into dealing with slaves. And something inside of him died. She had to sell everything she owned. And froze up inside. And when it finally, the bottom fell out. I became withdrawn. The only thing I knew how to do. Was to keep on keeping on. Like a bird that flew. Tangled up in blue. . So now I'm going back again. I got to get to her somehow. All the people we used to know. They're an illusion to me now. Some are mathematicians. Some are carpenter's wives. Don't know how it all got started. I don't know what they're doing with their lives. But me, I'm still on the road. A-heading for another joint. We always did feel the same. We just saw it from a different point. Of view. Tangled up in blue"
169,Simple Twist of Fate,Blood on the Tracks,1975,1,Original,15,". They sat together in the park. As the evening sky grew dark. She looked at him and he felt a spark. Tingle to his bones. 'Twas then he felt alone. And wished that he'd gone straight. And watched out for a simple twist of fate. . . They walked alone by the old canal. A little confused, I remember well. And stopped into a strange hotel. With a neon burning bright. He felt the heat of the night. Hit him like a freight train. Moving with a simple twist of fate. . . A saxophone someplace far-off played. As she was walking on by the arcade. As the light bust through a beat-up shade. Where he was wakin' up. She dropped a coin into the cup. Of a blind man at the gate. And forgot about a simple twist of fate. . . . He woke up, the room was bare. He didn't see her anywhere. He told himself he didn't care. Pushed the window open wide. Felt an emptiness inside. To which he just could not relate. Brought on by a simple twist of fate. . He hears the ticking of the clocks. And walks along with a parrot that talks. Hunts her down by the waterfront docks. Where the sailors all come in. Maybe she'll pick him out again. How long must he wait?. One more time, for a simple twist of fate. . . People tell me it's a sin. To know and feel too much within. I still believe she was my twin. But I lost the ring. She was born in spring. But I was born too late. Blame it on a simple twist of fate"

You made it there somehow. You're a big girl now. . . Bird on the horizon, sitting on a fence. He's singing his song for me at his own expense. And I'm just like that bird, oh, oh. Singing just for you. I hope that you can hear. Hear me singing through these tears. . . Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast. Oh, but what a shame that all we've shared can't last. I can change, I swear, oh, oh. See what you can do. I can make it through. You can make it too. . . Love is so simple, to quote a phrase. You've known it all the time, I'm learning it these days. Oh, I know where I can find you, oh, oh. In somebody's room. It's a price I have to pay. You're a big girl all the way. . A change in the weather is known to be extreme. But what's the sense of changing horses in midstream?. I'm going out of my mind, oh, oh. With a pain that stops and starts. Like a corkscrew to my heart. Ever since we've been apart"
171,Idiot Wind,Blood on the Tracks,1975,1,Original,15,". Someone’s got it in for me. They’re planting stories in the press. Whoever it is I wish they’d cut it out quick. But when they will I can only guess. They say I shot a man named Gray. And took his wife to Italy. She inherited a million bucks. And when she died it came to me. I can’t help it if I’m lucky. . . People see me all the time. And they just can’t remember how to act. Their minds are filled with big ideas. Images and distorted facts. Even you, yesterday. You had to ask me where it was at. I couldn’t believe after all these years. You didn’t know me any better than that. Sweet lady. . . Idiot wind. Blowing every time you move your mouth. Blowing down the backroads heading south. Idiot wind. Blowing every time you move your teeth. You’re an idiot, babe. It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe. . I ran into the fortune-teller. Who said beware of lightning that might strike. I haven’t known peace and quiet. For so long, I can’t remember what it’s like. There’s a lone soldier on the cross. Smoke pouring out of a boxcar door. You didn’t know it, you didn’t think it could be done. In the final end he won the war. After losing every battle. . . I woke up on the roadside. Daydreaming about the way things sometimes are. Visions of your chestnut mare. Shoot through my head and are making me see stars. You hurt the ones that I love best. And cover up the truth with lies. One day you’ll be in the ditch. Flies buzzing around your eyes. Blood on your saddle. . . Idiot wind. Blowing through the flowers on your tomb. Blowing through the curtains in your room. Idiot wind. Blowing every time you move your teeth. You’re an idiot, babe. It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe. . It was gravity which pulled us down. And destiny which broke us apart. You tamed the lion in my cage. But it just wasn’t enough to change my heart. Now everything’s a little upside down. As a matter of fact, the wheels have stopped. What’s good is bad, what’s bad is good. You’ll find out when you reach the top. You’re on the bottom. . . I noticed at the ceremony. Your corrupt ways had finally made you blind. I can’t remember your face anymore. Your mouth has changed, your eyes don’t look into mine. The priest wore black on the seventh day. And sat stone-faced while the building burned. I waited for you on the running boards. Near the cypress trees, while the springtime turned. Slowly into Autumn. . . Idiot wind. Blowing like a circle around my skull. From the Grand Coulee Dam to the Capitol. Idiot wind. Blowing every time you move your teeth. You’re an idiot, babe. It’s a wonder that you still know how to breathe. . I can’t feel you anymore. I can’t even touch the books you’ve read. Every time I crawl past your door. I been wishing I've been somebody else instead. Down the highway, down the tracks. Down the road to ecstasy. I followed you beneath the stars. Hounded by your memory. And all your raging glory. . . I been double-crossed now. For the very last time and now I’m finally free. I kissed goodbye the howling beast. On the borderline which separated you from me. You’ll never know the hurt I suffered. Nor the pain I rise above. And I’ll never know the same about you. Your holiness or your kind of love. And it makes me feel so sorry. . . Idiot wind. Blowing through the buttons of our coats. Blowing through the letters that we wrote. Idiot wind. Blowing through the dust upon our shelves. We’re idiots, babe. It’s a wonder we can even feed ourselves"

It always just hit me from below. But this time 'round it’s more correct. Right on target, so direct. You're gonna make me lonesome when you go. . . Purple clover, Queen Anne's lace. Crimson hair across your face. You could make me cry, if you don’t know. Can’t remember what I was thinking of. You might be spoilin’ me too much love. You're gonna make me lonesome when you go. . . Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy. Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme. Blue river running slow and lazy. I could stay with you forever and never realize the time. . Situations have ended sad. Relationships have all been bad. Mine’ve been like Verlaine’s and Rimbaud. But there’s no way I can compare. All them scenes to this affair.

You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to. . . I’ll look for you in old Honolulu. San Francisco or Ashtabula. You're gonna have to leave me now, I know. But I’ll see you in the sky above.

174,"Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts",Blood on the Tracks,1975,1,Original,15,". The festival was over, and the boys were all planning for a fall. The cabaret was quiet except for the drilling in the wall. The curfew had been lifted and the gambling wheel shut down. Anyone with any sense had already left town. He was standing in the doorway looking like the Jack of Hearts. . . He moved across the mirrored room, “Set it up for everyone,” he said. Then everyone commenced to do what they were doing before he turned their heads. Then he walked up to a stranger and he asked him with a grin. “Could you kindly tell me, friend, what time the show begins?”. Then he moved into the corner, face down like the Jack of Hearts. . . Backstage the girls were playing five-card stud by the stairs. Lily had two queens, she was hoping for a third to match her pair. Outside the streets were filling up, the window was open wide. A gentle breeze was blowing, you could feel it from inside. Lily called another bet and drew up the Jack of Hearts. . . Big Jim was no one’s fool, he owned the town's only diamond mine. He made his usual entrance looking so dandy and so fine. With his bodyguards and silver cane and every hair in place. He took whatever he wanted to and he laid it all to waste. But his bodyguards and silver cane were no match for the Jack of Hearts. . Rosemary combed her hair and took a carriage into town. She slipped in through the side door looking like a queen without a crown. She fluttered her false eyelashes and whispered in his ear. “Sorry, darling, that I’m late,” but he didn't seem to hear. He was staring into space over at the Jack of Hearts. . . “I know I’ve seen that face somewhere,” Big Jim was thinking to himself. “Maybe down in Mexico or a picture up on somebody’s shelf”. But then the crowd began to stamp their feet and the house lights did dim. And in the darkness of the room there was only Jim and him. Staring at the butterfly who just drew the Jack of Hearts. . . Lily was a princess, she was fair-skinned and precious as a child. She did whatever she had to do, she had that certain flash every time she smiled. She had come away from a broken home, had lots of strange affairs. With men in every walk of life which took her everywhere. But she’d never met anyone quite like the Jack of Hearts. . . The hanging judge came in unnoticed and was being wined and dined. The drilling in the wall kept up but no one seemed to pay it any mind. It was known all around that Lily had Jim’s ring. And nothing would ever come between Lily and the king. No, nothing ever would except maybe the Jack of Hearts. . Rosemary started drinking hard and seeing her reflection in the knife. She was tired of the attention, tired of playing the role of Big Jim’s wife. She had done a lot of bad things, even once tried suicide. Was looking to do just one good deed before she died. She was gazing to the future, riding on the Jack of Hearts. . . Lily took her dress off, buried it away. “Has your luck run out?” she laughed at him, “Well, I guess you must. Have known it would someday. Be careful not to touch the wall, there’s a brand-new coat of paint. I’m glad to see you’re still alive, you’re looking like a saint”. Down the hallway footsteps were coming for the Jack of Hearts. . . The backstage manager was pacing all around by his chair. “There’s something funny going on,” he said, “I can just feel it in the air”. He went to get the hanging judge, but the hanging judge was drunk. As the leading actor hurried by in the costume of a monk. There was no actor anywhere better than the Jack of Hearts. . . No one knew the circumstance but they say that it happened pretty quick. The door to the dressing room burst open and a Colt revolver clicked.

And I've never gotten used to it, I've just learned to turn it off. Either I'm too sensitive or else I'm gettin' soft. . . Sundown, yellow moon, I replay the past. I know every scene by heart, they all went by so fast. If she's passin' back this way, I'm not that hard to find. Tell her she can look me up if she's got the time"
176,Shelter from the Storm,Blood on the Tracks,1975,1,Original,15,". 'Twas in another lifetime. One of toil and blood. When blackness was a virtue. The road was full of mud.

And flowers in her hair. She walked up to me so gracefully. And took my crown of thorns. ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya. Shelter from the storm"". . . Now there's a wall between us. Something there's been lost. I took too much for granted. I got my signals crossed. Just to think that it all began. On an uneventful morn. ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya. Shelter from the storm"". . Well, the deputy walks on hard nails. And the preacher rides a mount. But nothing really matters much. It's doom alone that counts. And the one-eyed undertaker. He blows a futile horn. ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya. Shelter from the storm. . . I've heard newborn babies wailing. Like a mourning dove. And old men with broken teeth. Stranded without love. Do I understand your question, then. Is it hopeless and forlorn. ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya. Shelter from the storm"". . . In a little hilltop village. They gambled for my clothes. I bargained for salvation. And she gave me a lethal dose. I offered up my innocence. And I got repaid with scorn. ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya. Shelter from the storm"". . Well, I'm living in a foreign country. But I'm bound to cross the line. Beauty walks a razor's edge. Someday I'll make it mine. If I could only turn back the clock. To when God and her were born. ""Come in,"" she said, ""I'll give ya. Shelter from the storm"""

Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been. The champion of the world. . . Three bodies lyin' there. Does Patty see. And another man named Bello. Moving around mysteriously. “I didn’t do it,” he says. And he throws up his hands. “I was only robbin' the register. I hope you understand. . . I saw them leaving,” he says, and he stops. “One of us had better call up the cops”. And so Patty calls the cops. And they arrive on the scene. With their red lights flashin'. In the hot New Jersey night. . Meanwhile, far away in another part of town. Rubin Carter and a couple of friends are drivin' around. Number one contender for the middleweight crown. Had no idea what kinda shit was about to go down. . . When a cop pulled him over to the side of the road. Just like the time before and the time before that. In Paterson that’s just the way things go. If you’re black. You might as well not show up on the street. Unless you want to draw the heat. . .

They jumped into a white car with out-of-state plates”. . . And Miss Patty Valentine just nodded her head. Cop said, “Wait a minute, boys, this one’s not dead”. So they took him to the infirmary. And though this man could hardly see. They told him that he could identify the guilty men. . Four in the morning and they haul Rubin in. They take him to the hospital and they brought him upstairs.

We want to put his ass in stir. We want to pin this triple murder. On him. He ain’t no Gentleman Jim”. . . Rubin could take a man out with just one punch.

Where the trout streams flow and the air is nice. And ride a horse along a trail. But then they took him to the jailhouse. Where they try to turn a man. Into a mouse. . .

He was a revolutionary bum. . . And to the black folks he was just a crazy nigga. No one doubted that he pulled the trigger. And though they could not produce the gun. The D.A. said he was the one. Who did the deed. And the all-white jury agreed. . . Rubin Carter was falsely tried. The crime was murder “one,”. Guess who testified?. Bello and Bradley and they both baldly lied. And the newspapers, they all went along for the ride. . . How can the life of such a man. Be in the palm of some fool’s hand?. To see him obviously framed. Couldn’t help but make me feel ashamed.

In a ten-foot cell. An innocent man in a living hell. . . Yes that’s the story of the Hurricane. But it won’t be over till they clear his name. And give him back the time he’s done. Put in a prison cell, but one time he could-a been. The champion of the world"

Said “I got no money”. He said “That ain't necessary”. . . We set out that night, for the cold in the North. I gave him my blanket, and he gave me his word. I said “Where are we going?” He said we’d be back by the fourth. I said “That’s the best news that I’ve ever heard”. . . I was thinking about turquoise, I was thinking about gold.

I still can’t remember all the best things she said. . . We came to the pyramids, all embedded in ice. He said “There’s a body I’m trying to find. If I carry it out it’ll bring a good price”.

I felt I’d been had. When I saw that my partner was just being friendly. When I took up his offer I must have been mad. . . I picked up his body and I dragged him inside. Threw him down in the hole, and I put back the cover. I said a quick prayer, then I felt satisfied. Then I rode back to find Isis, just to tell her I love her. . She was there, in the meadow, where the creek used to rise. Blinded by sleep, and in need of a bed. I came in from the East, with the sun in my eyes. I cursed her one time, then I rode on ahead. . . She said “Where you been?”. I said “No place special”. She said “You look different”. I said “Well. I guess”. She said “You been gone”. I said “That’s only natural”. She said “You going to stay?”. I said “If you want me to, yes"". . . Isis, oh, Isis, you mystical child. What drives me to you is what drives me insane. I still can remember the way that you smiled.

When they tried to strangle Larry, Joey almost hit the roof. He went out that night to seek revenge, thinking he was bulletproof. . The war broke out at the break of dawn, it emptied out the streets.

They stashed them away in a basement, called them amateurs. . “Let’s blow this place to kingdom come, let Con Edison take the blame”.

He did ten years in Attica, reading Nietzsche and Wilhelm Reich. They threw him in the hole one time for trying to stop a strike. His closest friends were black men because they seemed to understand.

King of the streets, child of clay. Joey, Joey. What made them want to come and blow you away?. . . Sister Jacqueline and Carmela and mother Mary all did weep. I heard his best friend Frankie say, “He is not dead, he’s just asleep”. Then I saw the old man’s limousine head back towards the grave. I guess he had to say one last goodbye to the son that he could not save. The sun turned cold over President Street and the town of Brooklyn mourned. They said a mass in the old church near the house where he was born. And someday if God’s in heaven overlooking His preserve. I know the men that shot him down will get what they deserve. . . Joey, Joey. King of the streets, child of clay. Joey, Joey. What made them want to come and blow you away?"

209,Black Diamond Bay,Desire,1976,1,Original,17,". Up on the white veranda. She wears a necktie and a Panama hat. Her passport shows a face. From another time and place. She looks nothing like that. And all the remnants of her recent past. Are scattered in the wild wind. She walks across the marble floor. Where a voice from the gambling room is calling her to come on in. She smiles, walks the other way. As the last ship sails and the moon fades away. From Black Diamond Bay. . . As the morning light breaks open, the Greek comes down. And he asks for a rope and a pen that will write. “Pardon, monsieur,” the desk clerk says. Carefully removes his fez. “Am I hearing you right?”. And as the yellow fog is lifting. The Greek is quickly heading for the second floor. She passes him on the spiral staircase. Thinking he’s the Soviet Ambassador. She starts to speak, but he walks away. As the storm clouds rise and the palm branches sway. On Black Diamond Bay. . A soldier sits beneath the fan. Doing business with a tiny man who sells him a ring. Lightning strikes, the lights blow out. The desk clerk wakes and begins to shout. “Can you see anything?”. Then the Greek appears on the second floor. In his bare feet with a rope around his neck. While a loser in the gambling room lights up a candle. Says, “Open up another deck”. But the dealer says, “Attendez-vous, s’il vous plait”. As the rain beats down and the cranes fly away. From Black Diamond Bay. . . The desk clerk heard the woman laugh. As he looked around the aftermath and the soldier got tough. He tried to grab the woman’s hand. Said, “Here’s a ring, it cost a grand”. She said, “That ain't enough”. Then she ran upstairs to pack her bags. While a horse-drawn taxi waited at the curb. She passed the door that the Greek had locked. Where a handwritten sign read, “Do Not Disturb”. She knocked upon it anyway. As the sun went down and the music did play. On Black Diamond Bay. . “I’ve got to talk to someone quick!”. But the Greek said, “Go away,” and he kicked the chair to the floor. He hung there from the chandelier. She cried, “Help, there’s danger near. Please open up the door!”. Then the volcano erupted. And the lava flowed down from the mountain high above. The soldier and the tiny man were crouched in the corner. Thinking of forbidden love. But the desk clerk said, “It happens every day”. As the stars fell down and the fields burned away. On Black Diamond Bay. . . As the island slowly sank. The loser finally broke the bank in the gambling room. The dealer said, “It’s too late now. You can take your money, but I don’t know how. You’ll spend it in the tomb”. The tiny man bit the soldier’s ear. As the floor caved in and the boiler in the basement blew. While she’s out on the balcony, where a stranger tells her. “My darling, je vous aime beaucoup”. She sheds a tear and then begins to pray. As the fire burns on and the smoke drifts away. From Black Diamond Bay. . I was sitting home alone one night in L.A. Watching old Cronkite on the seven o’clock news. It seems there was an earthquake that. Left nothing but a Panama hat. And a pair of old Greek shoes. Didn’t seem like much was happening. So I turned it off and went to grab another beer. Seems like every time you turn around. There’s another hard-luck story that you’re going to hear. And there’s really nothing anyone can say. And I never did plan to go anyway. To Black Diamond Bay"

Renegade priests and treacherous young witches. Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you. . The palace of mirrors where dog soldiers are reflected. The endless road and the wailing of chimes. The empty rooms where her memory is protected. Where the angels' voices whisper to the souls of previous times. . . She wakes him up, forty-eight hours later the sun is breaking. Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks. She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking. He's pulling her down and she's clutching onto his long golden locks. . . Gentlemen, he said I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes. I've moved your mountains and marked your cards. But Eden is burning either get ready for elimination. Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards. . .

They’re not even sure you exist. . . Socialism, hypnotism, patriotism, materialism. Fools making laws for the breaking of jaws. And the sound of the keys as they clink. But there’s no time to think. . . The bridge that you travel on goes to the Babylon girl. With the rose in her hair. Starlight in the East and you’re finally released.

Well, the marshal, now he beat that kid to a bloody pulp.

She said, “Henry ain’t here but you can come on in, he’ll be back in a little while”. . . Then she told us how times were tough and about how she was thinking’ of. Bumming a ride back from where she started. But ya know, she changed the subject every time money came up. She said, “Welcome to the land of the living dead”.

She said, “Even the swap meets around here are getting pretty corrupt”. . “How far are y’all going?” Ruby asked us with a sigh. “We’re going all the way ’til the wheels fall off and burn. ’Til the sun peels the paint and the seat covers fade and the water moccasin dies”.

It said, “A man with no alibi”. You went out on a limb to testify for me, you said I was with you. Then when I saw you break down in front of the judge and cry real tears. It was the best acting I saw anybody do. . Now I’ve always been the kind of person that doesn’t like to trespass. But sometimes you just find yourself over the line.

If you were just here by my side to show me how. . . Well, I’m standing’ in line in the rain to see a movie starring Gregory Peck. Yeah, but you know it’s not the one that I had in mind.

Teeth like pearls shining like the moon above. Brownsville girl, show me all around the world. Brownsville girl, you’re my honey love. . . You know, it’s funny how things never turn out the way you had ’em planned. The only thing we knew for sure about Henry Porter is that his name wasn’t Henry Porter. And you know there was somethin’ about you baby that I liked that was always too good for this world. Just like you always said there was somethin’ about me you liked. That I left behind in the French Quarter. . . Strange how people who suffer together have stronger connections than people who are most content. I don’t have any regrets, they can talk about me plenty when I’m gone. You always said people don’t do what they believe in, they just do what’s most convenient, then they repent. And I always said, “Hang on to me, baby, and let’s hope that the roof stays on”. . . There was a movie I seen one time, I think I sat through it twice.

He whispered in her ear: “This is all your fault. My fighting days have come to a halt”. . . She touched his lips and kissed his cheek. He tried to speak but his breath was weak. “You died for me, now I’ll die for you”. She put the blade to her heart and she ran it through. . . All three lovers together in a heap.

I feel the holy spirit inside. See the light that freedom gives. I believe it's in the reach of. Every man who lives. Keep as far away as possible. It's darkest 'fore the dawn (Oh Lord). I turned the key, I broke it off. And I crossed the Rubicon. . . Mona, baby, are you still in my mind?. I truly believe that you are. Couldn't be anybody else but you. Who's come with me this far. The killing frost is on the ground. And the autumn leaves are gone. I lit the torch, I looked to the east. And I crossed the Rubicon"

456,Murder Most Foul,Rough and Rowdy,2020,6,Original,39,". 'Twas a dark day in Dallas, November '63. A day that will live on in infamy. President Kennedy was a-ridin' high. Good day to be livin' and a good day to die. Being led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb. He said, ""Wait a minute, boys, you know who I am?"". ""Of course we do, we know who you are"". Then they blew off his head while he was still in the car. Shot down like a dog in broad daylight. Was a matter of timing and the timing was right. You got unpaid debts, we've come to collect. We're gonna kill you with hatred, without any respect. We'll mock you and shock you and we'll grin in your face. We've already got someone here to take your place.

Greatest magic trick ever under the sun. Perfectly executed, skillfully done. Wolfman, oh Wolfman, oh Wolfman, howl. Rub-a-dub-dub, it's a murder most foul. . . Hush, little children, you'll understand. The Beatles are comin', they're gonna hold your hand. Slide down the banister, go get your coat. Ferry 'cross the Mersey and go for the throat. There's three bums comin' all dressed in rags. Pick up the pieces and lower the flags. I'm goin' to Woodstock, it's the Aquarian Age. Then I'll go over to Altamont and sit near the stage. Put your head out the window, let the good times roll. There's a party going on behind the Grassy Knoll. Stack up the bricks, pour the cement. Don't say Dallas don't love you, Mr. President. Put your foot in the tank and then step on the gas. Try to make it to the triple underpass. Blackface singer, whiteface clown. Better not show your faces after the sun goes down. Up in the red light district, like a cop on the beat. Living in a nightmare on Elm Street. When you're down on Deep Ellum, put your money in your shoe. Don't ask what your country can do for you. Cash on the barrelhead, money to burn. Dealey Plaza, make a left-hand turn. I'm going down to the crossroads, gonna flag a ride. The place where faith, hope, and charity died. Shoot him while he runs, boy, shoot him while you can. See if you can shoot the invisible man. Goodbye, Charlie, goodbye, Uncle Sam. Frankly, Miss Scarlett, I don't give a damn. What is the truth, and where did it go?. Ask Oswald and Ruby, they oughta know. ""Shut your mouth,"" said a wise old owl. Business is business, and it's a murder most foul. . Tommy, can you hear me? I'm the Acid Queen. I'm riding in a long, black Lincoln limousine. Ridin' in the back seat next to my wife. Headed straight on in to the afterlife. I'm leaning to the left, I got my head in her lap. Oh Lord, I've been led into some kind of a trap. Where we ask no quarter, and no quarter do we give. We're right down the street, from the street where you live. They mutilated his body and they took out his brain. What more could they do? They piled on the pain. But his soul was not there where it was supposed to be at. For the last fifty years they've been searchin' for that. Freedom, oh freedom, freedom over me. I hate to tell you, mister, but only dead men are free. Send me some lovin', then tell me no lie. Throw the gun in the gutter and walk on by. Wake up, little Susie, let's go for a drive. Cross the Trinity River, let's keep hope alive. Turn the radio on, don't touch the dials. Parkland Hospital, only six more miles. You got me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, you filled me with lead. That magic bullet of yours has gone to my head. I'm just a patsy like Patsy Cline. Never shot anyone from in front or behind. I've blood in my eye, got blood in my ear. I'm never gonna make it to the new frontier. Zapruder's film, I've seen that before. Seen it thirty-three times, maybe more. It's vile and deceitful, it's cruel and it's mean. Ugliest thing that you ever have seen. They killed him once and they killed him twice. Killed him like a human sacrifice. The day that they killed him, someone said to me, ""Son. The age of the Antichrist has just only begun"". Air Force One comin' in through the gate. Johnson sworn in at 2:38. Let me know when you decide to throw in the towel. It is what it is, and it's murder most foul. . What's new, pussycat? What'd I say?.
